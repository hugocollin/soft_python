In this paper, developing themethod in the papers much further, we explicitly give projective models of anumber of new Moishezon twistor spaces, as conic bundles over some rationalsurfaces (called minitwistor spaces). These include the twistor spaces studiedin the papers as very special cases.  Our source of the result is a series of self-dual metrics with torus actionconstructed by D. Joyce. Actually, for arbitrary Joyce metrics andU(1)-subgroups of the torus which fixes a torus-invariant 2-sphere, we firstdetermine the associated minitwistor spaces in explicit forms. Next byanalyzing the meromorphic maps from the twistor spaces to the minitwistorspaces, we realize projective models of the twistor spaces of all Joycemetrics, as conic bundles over the minitwistor spaces. Then we prove that forany one of these minitwistor spaces, there exist Moishezon twistor spaces withonly C*-action whose quotient space is the given minitwistor space. This resultgenerates numerous Moishezon twistor spaces which cannot be found in theliterature (including the author's papers), in quite explicit form.\n",

      "Texte : Let $\\mathcal{H}$ be Hilbert space and $(\\Omega,\\mu)$ a $\\sigma$-finitemeasure space. Multiplicatively invariant (MI) spaces are closed subspaces of $L^2(\\Omega, \\mathcal{H})$ that are invariant under point-wise multiplication byfunctions in a fix subset of $L^{\\infty}(\\Omega).$ Given a finite set of data$\\mathcal{F}\\subseteq L^2(\\Omega, \\mathcal{H}),$ in this paper we prove theexistence and construct an MI space $M$ that best fits $\\mathcal{F}$, in theleast squares sense. MI spaces are related to shift invariant (SI) spaces via afiberization map, which allows us to solve an approximation problem for SIspaces in the context of locally compact abelian groups. On the other hand, weintroduce the notion of decomposable MI spaces (MI spaces that can bedecomposed into an orthogonal sum of MI subspaces) and solve the approximationproblem for the class of these spaces. Since SI spaces having extra invarianceare in one-to-one relation to decomposable MI spaces, we also solve ourapproximation problem for this class of SI spaces. Finally we prove thattranslation invariant spaces are in correspondence with totally decomposable MIspaces.\n",

      "Texte : A construction analogous to that of Godefroy-Kalton for metric spaces allowsto embed isometrically, in a canonical way, every quasi-metric space $(X,d)$ toan asymmetric normed space $\\mathcal{F}_a(X,d)$ (its quasi-metric free space,also called asymmetric free space or semi-Lipschitz free space). Thequasi-metric free space satisfies a universal property (linearization ofsemi-Lipschitz functions). The (conic) dual of $\\mathcal{F}_a(X,d)$ coincideswith the nonlinear asymmetric dual of $(X,d)$, that is, the space$\\mathrm{SLip}_0(X,d)$ of semi-Lipschitz functions on $(X,d)$, vanishing at abase point. In particular, for the case of a metric space $(X,D)$, the aboveconstruction yields its usual free space. On the other hand, every metric space$(X,D)$ inherits naturally a canonical asymmetrization coming from its freespace $\\mathcal{F}(X)$. This gives rise to a quasi-metric space $(X,D_+)$ andan asymmetric free space $\\mathcal{F}_a(X,D_+)$. The symmetrization of thelatter is isomorphic to the original free space $\\mathcal{F}(X)$. The resultsof this work are illustrated with explicit examples.\n",

Allthese results strongly depend on the geometrical properties, reflected via itsdyadic cubes, of the considered space of homogeneous type. Comparing with theknown theory of these spaces on metric measure spaces, a major novelty of thisarticle is that all results presented in this article get rid of the dependenceon the reverse doubling assumption of the considered measure of the underlyingspace and hence give a final real-variable theory of these function spaces onspaces of homogeneous type.\n",

      "Texte : The distance function $\\varrho(p,q)$ (or $d(p,q)$) of a distance space(general metric space) is not differentiable in general. We investigate suchdistance spaces over $\\mathbb R^n$, whose distance functions are differentiablelike in case of Finsler spaces. These spaces have several good properties, yetthey are no Finsler spaces (which are special distance spaces). They aresituated between general metric spaces (distance spaces) and Finsler spaces. Wewill investigate such curves of differentiable distance spaces, which possessthe same properties as geodesics do in Finsler spaces. So these curves can beconsidered as forerunners of Finsler geodesics. They are in greater plenitudethan Finsler geodesics, but they become geodesics in a Finsler space. We showsome properties of these curves, as well as some relations betweendifferentiable distance spaces and Finsler spaces. We arrive to these curvesand to our results by using distance spheres, and using no variationalcalculus. We often apply direct geometric considerations.\n",

We construct intersection space pairs forpseudomanifolds with compatible trivial structures at the link fibrations; thisincludes the case of toric varieties. We define intersection space complexes inan axiomatic way, similar to Goresky-McPherson axioms for intersectioncohomology. We prove that if the intersection space exists, then thepseudomanifold has an intersection space complex whose hypercohomology recoversthe cohomology of the intersection space pair. We characterize existence anduniqueness of intersection space complexes in terms of the derived category ofconstructible complexes. We show that intersection space complexes of algebraicvarieties lift to the derived category of Mixed Hodge Modules, endowingintersection space cohomology with a Mixed Hodge Structure. We find classes ofexamples admitting intersection space complex, and counterexamples notadmitting them; they are in particular the first examples known not admittingBanagl intersection spaces.

The TC spaces are alsoknown as Arens-Eells, Lipschitz-free, or Wasserstein spaces. A new notion of aroadmap pertinent to a transportation problem on a finite metric space has beenintroduced and used to simplify proofs for the results on representation of TCspaces as quotients of $\\ell_1$ spaces on the edge set over the cycle space. ATolstoi-type theorem for roadmaps is proved, and directed subgraphs of thecanonical graphs, which are supports of maximal optimal roadmaps, arecharacterized. Possible obstacles for a TC space on a finite metric space $X$preventing them from containing subspaces isometric to $\\ell_\\infty^n$ havebeen found in terms of the canonical graph of $X$. The fact that TC spaces ondiamond graphs do not contain $\\ell_\\infty^4$ isometrically has been derived.In addition, a short overview of known results on the isometric structure of TCspaces on finite metric spaces is presented.\n",

      "Texte : In this paper, we mainly study the function spaces related to H-sober spaces.For an irreducible subset system H and $T_{0}$ spaces $X$ and $Y$, it is provedthat $Y$ is H-sober iff the function space $\\mathbb{C}(X, Y)$ of all continuousfunctions $f : X\\longrightarrow Y$ equipped with the topology of pointwiseconvergence is H-sober iff the function space $\\mathbb{C}(X, Y)$ equipped withthe Isbell topology is H-sober. One immediate corollary is that for a $T_{0}$space $X$, $Y$ is a sober space (resp., $d$-space, well-filtered space) iff thefunction space $\\mathbb{C}(X, Y)$ equipped with the topology of pointwiseconvergence is a sober space (resp., $d$-space, well-filtered space) iff thefunction space $\\mathbb{C}(X, Y)$ equipped with the the Isbell topology is asober space (resp., $d$-space, well-filtered space).

For a subset system H, the theory of H-sober spaces and superH-sober spaces is established, and a direct construction of the H-sobrifcationsand super H-sobrifications of $T_0$ spaces is given. Therefore, the category ofall H-sober spaces is reflective in $\\mathbf{Top}_0$, and the category of allsuper H-sober spaces is also reflective in $\\mathbf{Top}_0$ if H has a naturalproperty (called property M).

      "Texte : A matrix space of size $m\\times n$ is a linear subspace of the linear spaceof $m\\times n$ matrices over a field $\\mathbb{F}$. The rank of a matrix spaceis defined as the maximal rank over matrices in this space. A matrix space$\\mathcal{A}$ is called rank-critical, if any matrix space which properlycontains it has rank strictly greater than that of $\\mathcal{A}$.  In this note, we first exhibit a necessary and sufficient condition for amatrix space $\\mathcal{A}$ to be rank-critical, when $\\mathbb{F}$ is largeenough. This immediately implies the sufficient condition for a matrix space tobe rank-critical by Draisma (Bull. Lond. Math. Soc. 38(5):764--776, 2006),albeit requiring the field to be slightly larger.  We then study rank-critical spaces in the context of compression andprimitive matrix spaces. We first show that every rank-critical matrix spacecan be decomposed into a rank-critical compression matrix space and arank-critical primitive matrix space. We then prove, using our necessary andsufficient condition, that the block-diagonal direct sum of two rank-criticalmatrix spaces is rank-critical if and only if both matrix spaces are primitive,when the field is large enough.\n",

      "Texte : To remove the confusion of concepts about different sorts of geographicalspace and dimension, a new framework of space theory is proposed in this paper.Based on three sets of fractal dimensions, the geographical space is dividedinto three types: real space (R-space), phase space (P-space), and order space(O-space). The real space is concrete or visual space, the fractal dimension ofwhich can be evaluated through digital maps or remotely sensed images. Thephase space and order space are both abstract space, the fractal dimensionvalues of which cannot be estimated with one or two maps or images. Thedimension of phase space can be computed by using time series, and that oforder space can be determined with cross-sectional data in certain time. Threeexamples are offered to illustrate the three types of spaces and fractaldimension of geographical systems. The new space theory can be employed toexplain the parameters of geographical scaling laws, such as the scalingexponent of the allometric growth law of cities and the fractal dimension basedon Horton's laws of rivers.\n",

In order to compare the performance betweennetwork coding in space and routing in space, this paper quantitatively studiestwo classes of network coding in space and optimal routing in space when anyterminal node moves arbitrarily in two-dimensional Euclidean space, and costadvantage is used as the metric. Furthermore, the upper-bound of cost advantageis figured out as well as the region where network coding in space is superiorto routing in space.

      "Texte : Coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscope system was built andapplied to a non-intrusive gas concentration measurement of a mixing flow in amillimeter-scale channel. Carbon dioxide and nitrogen were chosen as testfluids and CARS signals from the fluids were generated by adjusting thewavelengths of the Pump and the Stokes beams. The generated CARS signals, whosewavelengths are different from those of the Pump and the Stokes beams, werecaptured by an EM-CCD camera after filtering out the excitation beams. Acalibration experiment was performed in order to confirm the applicability ofthe built-up CARS system by measuring the intensity of the CARS signal fromknown concentrations of the samples. After confirming that the measured CARSintensity was proportional to the second power of the concentrations as wastheoretically predicted, the CARS intensities in the gas mixing flow channelwere measured. Ten different measurement points were set and concentrations ofboth carbon dioxide and nitrogen at each point were obtained. Consequently, itwas observed that the mixing of two fluids progressed as the measurement pointmoved downstream. The results show the applicability of CARS to thenon-intrusive concentration measurement of gas flows without any preprocesssuch as gas absorption into liquid or solid.\n",

      "Texte : We consider two variations of the discrete car parking problem where at everyvertex of the integers a car arrives with rate one, now allowing for parking intwo lines. a) The car parks in the first line whenever the vertex and all ofits nearest neighbors are not occupied yet. It can reach the first line if itis not obstructed by cars already parked in the second line (screening). b) Thecar parks according to the same rules, but parking in the first line can not beobstructed by parked cars in the second line (no screening). In both models, acar that can not park in the first line will attempt to park in the secondline. If it is obstructed in the second line as well, the attempt is discarded.We show that both models are solvable in terms of finite-dimensional ODEs. Wecompare numerically the limits of first and second line densities, with timegoing to infinity. While it is not surprising that model a) exhibits anincrease of the density in the second line from the first line, more remarkablythis is also true for model b), albeit in a less pronounced way.\n",

      "Texte : In the field of car evaluation, more and more netizens choose to expresstheir opinions on the Internet platform, and these comments will affect thedecision-making of buyers and the trend of car word-of-mouth. As an importantbranch of natural language processing (NLP), sentiment analysis provides aneffective research method for analyzing the sentiment types of massive carreview texts. However, due to the lexical professionalism and large text noiseof review texts in the automotive field, when a general sentiment analysismodel is applied to car reviews, the accuracy of the model will be poor. Toovercome these above challenges, we aim at the sentiment analysis task of carreview texts. From the perspective of word vectors, pre-training is carried outby means of whole word mask of proprietary vocabulary in the automotive field,and then training data is carried out through the strategy of an adversarialtraining set. Based on this, we propose a car review text sentiment analysismodel based on adversarial training and whole word mask BERT(ATWWM-BERT).\n",

      "Texte : We consider a system of ordered cars moving in $\\R$ from right to left.  Each car is represented by a point in $\\R$; two or more cars can occupy thesame point but cannot overpass. Cars have two possible velocities: either 0 or1. An unblocked car needs an exponential random time of mean 1 to pass fromspeed 0 to speed 1 (\\emph{slow-to-start}). Car $i$, say, travels at speed 1until it (possibly) hits the stopped car $i-1$ to its left. After the departureof car $i-1$, car $i$ waits an exponential random time to change its speed to1, travels at this speed until it hits again stopped car $i-1$ and so on.Initially cars are distributed in $\\R$ according to a Poisson process ofparameter $\\lambda<1$. We show that every car will be stopped only a finitenumber of times and that the final relative car positions is again a Poissonprocess with parameter $\\lambda$. To do that, we relate the trajectories of thecars to a $M/M/1$ stationary queue as follows. Space in the traffic model istime for the queue. The initial positions of the cars coincide with the arrivalprocess of the queue and the final relative car positions match the departureprocess of the queue.\n",

      "Texte : Autonomous cars are well known for being vulnerable to adversarial attacksthat can compromise the safety of the car and pose danger to other road users.To effectively defend against adversaries, it is required to not only testautonomous cars for finding driving errors but to improve the robustness of thecars to these errors. To this end, in this paper, we propose a two-stepmethodology for autonomous cars that consists of (i) finding failure states inautonomous cars by training the adversarial driving agent, and (ii) improvingthe robustness of autonomous cars by retraining them with effective adversarialinputs. Our methodology supports testing autonomous cars in a multi-agentenvironment, where we train and compare adversarial car policy on two customreward functions to test the driving control decision of autonomous cars. Werun experiments in a vision-based high-fidelity urban driving simulatedenvironment. Our results show that adversarial testing can be used for findingerroneous autonomous driving behavior, followed by adversarial training forimproving the robustness of deep reinforcement learning-based autonomousdriving policies. We demonstrate that the autonomous cars retrained using theeffective adversarial inputs noticeably increase the performance of theirdriving policies in terms of reduced collision and offroad steering errors.\n",

      "Texte : Hello there,So didn't need to wait 1 year for this review since my previous car was also an Alpine A110, albeit a \"Pure\" (entry-range trim) version.This previous car gave me a taste of trackdays and so I made the decision to stay within the Alpine brand but with a version better tailored for the occasional fun on track. Reddit review : [https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/vdobo3/18month\\_ownership\\_review\\_alpine\\_a110/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/vdobo3/18month_ownership_review_alpine_a110/)  A change of job made the switch possible, I went for a trade-in on the A110 for peace of mind and the value was alright.My first car ever was a ND Miata with the 1.5L engine and 6MT, very fun and I kinda miss it sometimes : [https://www.reddit.com/r/Miata/comments/dlzlb5/shes\\_here\\_first\\_car\\_and\\_first\\_miata\\_just\\_waiting/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Miata/comments/dlzlb5/shes_here_first_car_and_first_miata_just_waiting/)The A110 Pure was a great experience, plenty fun on the road (more on that below) and definitely the most bangs for your buck version, paid 61.5K‚Ç¨ for it new with the must-have options, didn't felt like a lot.# The specSo with a larger budget this time I went for :\\- Alpine Blue paint : really didn't want this at first, it's the most common so wanted something different when I first specced the car.  Thunder Gray felt a bit boring for the sporty spec I had in mind, Abyss Blue is too dark and wouldn't let the carbon bits shine, Fire Orange was too much for me. So only had limited Atelier paints left at 5000‚Ç¨, Emerald Green is sweet but felt more at home on a Lotus, and Montebello Gray was already sold out.  So went for Alpine Blue in the end since it's actually pretty stunning for its price (1800‚Ç¨), sporty without being too show-off, and light enough to let the carbon bits contrast nicely. Would be a nice contrast with the S-trim orange bits too.\\- Carbon aero kit : really gives a much sportier look, although can leave the car looking less \"smooth\" but wanted all the track-day related options as well as an as different spec as possible compared to my previous Alpine, since I was already buying the same car I wanted to differentiate it strongly. 5400‚Ç¨ option (6400‚Ç¨ now).  Gives more downforce too of course, although you need to be on fast tracks to really feel it I'd say, but at least it'll always reduce lift and therefore participate in the tight chassis experience.\\- Carbon roof : same as the aero kit, shaves off 1.8kg pretty high so good way to lower the CoG, also looks very good imo. 2400‚Ç¨ option (3400‚Ç¨ now).\\- Forged Fuchs wheels in titanium gray paint : lighter wheels available and best-looking to me, another 1.500‚Ç¨ or so.  Went for red calipers to avoid the standard S orange ones, didn't look that great to me.\\- Extended alcantara interior pack : replace almost all the leather (wheel, bucket seats, central piece, dash, roof lining) with Alcantara, looks more sporty, less glare and very nice to have on the steering wheel imo, 2.000‚Ç¨ or so.\\- Blacked out light up front and translucent lights on the rear : gives a meaner look up front and gives the same look as the R version on the rear, felt like a good choice to avoid the classic red color to get a smoother rear end visually.\\- Focal Premium audio : had the standard Focal in the previous one, sounded very good for a small sportcar sound system so went for the best version this time, adding a sub and a better amp. Definitely gives more oomph to the sound especially at highway speeds, without feeling bloated and unbalanced, one of the truly surprising thing is this little 1130kg two-seater.\\- Orange safety belts to lighten up the interior and merge better with the S trim orange bits. Also harness pre-setup installation. It adds attach points to make it very easy to install harnesses later on, planning on doing this before Spring since I plan on going to Spa for a track-day.\\- And of course 300hp and the S chassis setup, more on that below.Total OOTD price was around 96k‚Ç¨, so around 50% more than my previous Alpine.It ends up looking like this : [https://imgur.com/a/kKvDACX](https://imgur.com/a/kKvDACX)# As a dailyStarting with this because it's actually my only car hehe.So I already knew how great the Alpine could be as a do-all machine, but the S was supposed to be a bit too stiff for every day traffic and city roads.  Well one short test-drive was enough to find the S to be perfectly livable enough and 3500km later I don't regret the switch on the daily stuff.It's indeed a bit rougher at low speeds and on bad pavement, but the low weight (2490 pounds !!) still lets the S breathes nicely with the road, and it's actually even smoother when you're going rapidly as the sharper chassis gives you more confidence.Storage space is still low but OK for a week or two away if you pack accordingly.It's way better for long highway drives with the sharper chassis, it doesn't wobble as much as the standard A110 so you don't have to grip the wheel as firmly. You can cruise at 150km/h for hours in relative silence and most importantly in total confidence, whereas the normal A110 is a bit more worrying at high speed turns and gets unsettled even more when it's windy.The Focal Premium is a nice addition for long drives too, giving clear and powerful balanced sound rendition.The new cars also have CarPlay so a big plus with Waze and Apple Music on the center screen.Lastly, the aero kit front spoiler is not as troublesome as I feared, the Alpine has a pretty good ground clearance so I can still take speed bumps easily. Only some weird angles in underground parkings or country roads junctions have to be approached with caution, I already bruised the underside of the front lip twice, lightly.# On the roadSo, how fun is it then ?Well, very ! It's still that magical little sportcar that gives you ton of fun like the A110 Pure, only even better.Biggest differences are the front end, the body control, steering feel and sound.The chassis is lower and stiffer and you feel it every second. The front end is massive fun, reminds me of the Lotus Elise Cup 250 I tried a few years ago before buying the A110.Steering was a weakish point on the base car, but here it has both more weight and better feedback, definitely not regretting I didn't went with a Lotus now that I have the S. Still not as great an Elise mind you, but really pretty nice and better than the 718 S I tried on track before ordering the S.Body control is much tighter, the base car is known for its overdone body roll, giving it magical compliance on the worst roads but making the car a bit unfocused at high speed and on track.  The S really goes for more of a German sportcar setup but manages to mostly keep that uncanny compliance thanks to the low weight.Brakes are still awesome, I had the 320mm optional discs on the Pure and they come standard on the S. My favorite brakes in this price segment, as fun to use as the steering wheel of an Elise/Exige, they're very un-assisted and give you tons of feedback, perfect for trail-braking. Just have to remove the little plastic bits in front in order to get a decent-enough cooling for the front brakes. Definitely good enough for trackday beginners, of course if you go to Spa/Nurb once a month and have a great level you'll want better pads and coolant at least.And the sound is finally good enough for my ears, I have to remind you it's a small 1.8L turbo 4-cylinder engine equipped with all the funny European stuff (particle filters, catalyser etc.) so sounding good wasn't a given.  But it does sound pretty nice, the 300hp engine setup have a more agressive pop-and-bang soundtrack, and the cabin noises are still very fun with lots of turbo/induction sounds. The engine really screams nicely behind your head when over 3000rpm.Engine power is also up, giving more kick to the car, both in low end torque and high end peak power, so you can speed up in a stronger manner after some fun corners on country roads or just have more breath to pass at highway speeds.So in the end, even though it was tailored for track use I find it to be a better choice for me on the open road.# On the trackWell the differences are even greater on track, after all this particular spec is made for this and it's the best place to enjoy the tighter chassis.The best difference is how much more confident you are with the S, the chassis is really talking to you in a clearer way at track speeds compared to the base car.  The front end is epic, massive, solid, planted, agile, you can attack any corner with huge confidence in what's happening up front and what's going to happen throughout the whole turn.The base car you had to really load the front under braking to get something solid but you'd lose the rear in the process. Here with the S the whole car stays composed and the front end is just tons of pure fun.The additional power is mostly felt on track too (300hp vs 252 for the Pure), it stops losing wind after 5500 rpm like in the base car and you get peak hp up until 6500 rpm here so more fun to explore the top range.Did my first trackday in October once I reached 3000km and it was lots of fun, no problem with the brakes for now.I have the Michelin PS4 tires so not even the best ones for the track. They were OK but you can feel they overheat a bit so have to keep sessions at 15mn max so they can cool down. Would love to try Cup2's but bad choice for a daily in winter here.On-board track video : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nzR92cQxQI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nzR92cQxQI)Fastest lap is the 5th one. # What about the A110R ? And closing thoughts.The R version launched 6 months before I took delivery of my S (12 months total wait time oof), so naturally I had big questions about it. It's mostly even better than my S (did some laps with a R owner on track) but some critical points are making it a bad choice as an only car, plus it's pretty overpriced for the small performance delta you get versus an aero kit-equipped S.  I could have changed my order for an R since the car doesn't enter actual production before the final 8 weeks or so but decided not to in the end.The R has carbon wheels, fixed passenger-side carbon bucket seats, no rear windows (carbon cover instead), and only harnesses (no safety belts possible). No front/rear proximity sensors either, no subwoofer audio option. And it's 30k‚Ç¨ over the S.  The suspensions are brilliant too, and it does look even sportier (in a good way) to me. But the massive price delta doesn't get justified, press reviews only found a minimal lap time diff with a Cup2 aero kit S.Still I love the carbon bucket seats, the carbon bonnet, the carbon skirts and rear diffuser, I'll try to snag some R-bits for my S down the road then.Apart from that I plan on keeping this S for the next 4 years because changing cars every 18 months like I did prior to that has proven to be quite the financial ruin. So I'll baby this one and have fun with it for quite some time, and may invest in some mods once the warranty is gone like titanium exhaust, Ohlins dampers, track-oriented brake mods...Always loved Lotus too but the Emira isn't what I'm interested in. Next step if I had the buying power would be a 911 GT3 or 718 GT4/RS but pretty sure they're not as fun on the open road though, still planning on renting both the 992 GT3 and 718 GT4RS on track in the coming months just to see what's up.   But yeah a two-seater as light and fun and polyvalent as my current S will indeed be hard to replace in the future I fear, we'll see !Hope you enjoyed the read (long one tho I'm sorry), don't hesitate if you have questions or anything. I always take the time of writing review for these Alpines since they're not available in the US so I guess some of you are curious.  Sorry in advance for any grammatical mistake, been a long time since I've wrote a long text in English.\n",

      "Texte : Exact mean field equations are derived analytically to give the fundamentaldiagrams, i.e., the average speed - car density relations, for theFukui-Ishibashi one-dimensional traffic flow cellular automaton model of highspeed vehicles $(v_{max}=M>1) $ with stochastic delay. Starting with the basicequation describing the time evolution of the number of empty sites in front ofeach car, the concepts of inter-car spacings longer and shorter than $M$ areintroduced. The probabilities of having long and short spacings on the road arecalculated. For high car densities $(\\rho \\geq 1/M)$, it is shown thatinter-car spacings longer than $M$ will be shortened as the traffic flowevolves in time, and any initial configurations approach a steady state inwhich all the inter-car spacings are of the short type. Similarly for low cardensities $(\\rho \\leq 1/M)$, it can be shown that traffic flow approaches anasymptotic steady state in which all the inter-car spacings are longer than$M-2$. The average traffic speed is then obtained analytically as a function ofcar density in the asymptotic steady state. The fundamental diagram so obtainedis in excellent agreement with simulation data.\n",

      "Texte : Modern cars are evolving in many ways. Technologies such as infotainmentsystems and companion mobile applications collect a variety of personal datafrom drivers to enhance the user experience. This paper investigates the extentto which car drivers understand the implications for their privacy, includingthat car manufacturers must treat that data in compliance with the relevantregulations. It does so by distilling out drivers' concerns on privacy andrelating them to their perceptions of trust on car cyber-security. Aquestionnaire is designed for such purposes to collect answers from a set of1101 participants, so that the results are statistically relevant. In short,privacy concerns are modest, perhaps because there still is insufficientgeneral awareness on the personal data that are involved, both for in-vehicletreatment and for transmission over the Internet. Trust perceptions oncyber-security are modest too (lower than those on car safety), a surprisingcontradiction to our research hypothesis that privacy concerns and trustperceptions on car cyber-security are opponent. We interpret this as a cleardemand for information and awareness-building campaigns for car drivers, aswell as for technical cyber-security and privacy measures that are trulyconsiderate of the human factor.\n",

      "Texte : Immunotherapies use components of the patient immune system to selectivelytarget cancer cells. The use of CAR T cells to treat B-cell malignancies--leukaemias and lymphomas-- is one of the most successful examples, with manypatients experiencing long-lasting complete responses to this therapy. Thistreatment works by extracting the patient's T cells and adding them the CARgroup, which enables them to recognize and target cells carrying the antigenCD19+, that is expressed in these haematological tumors.  Here we put forward a mathematical model describing the time response ofleukaemias to the injection of CAR T-cells. The model accounts for mature andprogenitor B-cells, tumor cells, CAR T cells and side effects by incorporatingthe main biological processes involved. The model explains the earlypost-injection dynamics of the different compartments and the fact that thenumber of CAR T cells injected does not critically affect the treatmentoutcome. An explicit formula is found that provides the maximum CAR T cellexpansion in-vivo and the severity of side effects. Our mathematical modelcaptures other known features of the response to this immunotherapy. It alsopredicts that CD19+ tumor relapses could be the result of the competitionbetween tumor and CAR T cells analogous to predator-prey dynamics. We discussthis fact on the light of available evidences and the possibility ofcontrolling relapses by early re-challenging of the tumor with stored CAR Tcells.\n",

      "Texte : In this paper, we present CarGameAR: An Integrated AR Car Game AuthoringInterface for Custom-Built Car Programed on Arduino Board. The car consists ofan Arduino board, an H-bridge, and motors. The objective of the project is tocreate a system that can move a car in different directions using a computerapplication. The system uses Unity software to create a virtual environmentwhere the user can control the car using keyboard commands. The car's motion isachieved by sending signals from the computer to the Arduino board, which thendrives the motors through the H-bridge. The project provides a cost-effectiveand efficient way to build a car, which can be used for educational purposes,such as teaching programming. Moreover, this project is not limited to thecontrol of the car through keyboard commands in a virtual environment. Thesystem can be adapted to support augmented reality (AR) technology, providingan even more immersive and engaging user experience. By integrating the carwith AR, the user can control the car's motion using physical gestures andmovements, adding an extra layer of interactivity to the system. This makes thecar an ideal platform for game development in AR, allowing the user to createdriving games that blend the physical and virtual worlds seamlessly.Additionally, the car's affordability and ease of construction make it anaccessible and valuable tool for teaching programming and principles in a funand interactive way. Overall, this project demonstrates the versatility andpotential of the car system, highlighting the various applications andpossibilities it offers for both education and entertainment.\n",

But as we get better at this optimization, we start seeingbehavior go from too conservative to too aggressive. The car's behavior exposesthe incentives we provide in its cost function. In this work, we argue for carsthat are not optimizing a purely selfish cost, but also try to be courteous toother interactive drivers. We formalize courtesy as a term in the objectivethat measures the increase in another driver's cost induced by the autonomouscar's behavior. Such a courtesy term enables the robot car to be aware ofpossible irrationality of the human behavior, and plan accordingly. We analyzethe effect of courtesy in a variety of scenarios. We find, for example, thatcourteous robot cars leave more space when merging in front of a human driver.Moreover, we find that such a courtesy term can help explain real human driverbehavior on the NGSIM dataset.\n",

      "Texte : Car detection, particularly through camera vision, has become a major focusin the field of computer vision and has gained widespread adoption. Whilecurrent car detection systems are capable of good detection, reliable detectioncan still be challenging due to factors such as proximity between the car,light intensity, and environmental visibility. To address these issues, wepropose cross-domain Car Detection Model with integrated convolutional blockAttention mechanism(CDMA) that we apply to car recognition for autonomousdriving and other areas. CDMA includes several novelties: 1)Building a completecross-domain target detection framework. 2)Developing an unpaired target domainpicture generation module with an integrated convolutional attention mechanismwhich specifically emphasizes the car headlights feature. 3)AdoptingGeneralized Intersection over Union (GIOU) as the loss function of the targetdetection framework. 4)Designing an object detection model integrated withtwo-headed Convolutional Block Attention Module(CBAM). 5)Utilizing an effectivedata enhancement method. To evaluate the model's effectiveness, we performed areduced will resolution process on the data in the SSLAD dataset and used it asthe benchmark dataset for our task. Experimental results show that theperformance of the cross-domain car target detection model improves by 40% overthe model without our framework, and our improvements have a significant impacton cross-domain car recognition.\n",

      "Texte : Traffic Congestions and accidents are major concerns in today'stransportation systems. This thesis investigates how to optimize traffic flowon highways, in particular for merging situations such as intersections where aramp leads onto the highway. In our work, cars are equipped with sensors thatcan detect distance to neighboring cars, and communicate their velocity andacceleration readings with one another. Sensor-enabled cars can locallyexchange sensed information about the traffic and adapt their behavior muchearlier than regular cars.  We propose proactive algorithms for merging different streams ofsensor-enabled cars into a single stream. A proactive merging algorithmdecouples the decision point from the actual merging point. Sensor-enabled carsallow us to decide where and when a car merges before it arrives at the actualmerging point. This leads to a significant improvement in traffic flow asvelocities can be adjusted appropriately. We compare proactive mergingalgorithms against the conventional priority-based merging algorithm in acontrolled simulation environment. Experiment results show that proactivemerging algorithms outperform the priority-based merging algorithm in terms offlow and delay.\n",

Accordingly, the security of assistant andself-drive systems in the cars becomes a life-threatening issue as smart carscan be invaded by malicious attacks that cause traffic accidents. Currently,canonical machine learning and deep learning methods are extensively employedin car hacking detection. However, machine learning and deep learning methodscan easily be overconfident and defeated by carefully designed adversarialexamples. Moreover, those methods cannot provide explanations for securityengineers for further analysis. In this work, we investigated Deep BayesianLearning models to detect and analyze car hacking behaviors. The Bayesianlearning methods can capture the uncertainty of the data and avoidoverconfident issues. Moreover, the Bayesian models can provide moreinformation to support the prediction results that can help security engineersfurther identify the attacks.

      "Texte : Once self-driving car becomes a reality and passengers are no longer worryabout it, they will need to find new ways of entertainment. However, retrievingentertainment contents at the Data Center (DC) can hinder content deliveryservice due to high delay of car-to-DC communication. To address thesechallenges, we propose a deep learning based caching for self-driving car, byusing Deep Learning approaches deployed on the Multi-access Edge Computing(MEC) structure. First, at DC, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) is used to predictthe probabilities of contents to be requested in specific areas. To reduce thecar-DC delay, MLP outputs are logged into MEC servers attached to roadsideunits. Second, in order to cache entertainment contents stylized for carpassengers' features such as age and gender, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)is used to predict age and gender of passengers. Third, each car requests MLPoutput from MEC server and compares its CNN and MLP outputs by using k-meansand binary classification. Through this, the self-driving car can identify thecontents need to be downloaded from the MEC server and cached. Finally, weformulate deep learning based caching in the self-driving car that enhancesentertainment services as an optimization problem whose goal is to minimizecontent downloading delay. To solve the formulated problem, a Block SuccessiveMajorization-Minimization (BS-MM) technique is applied. The simulation resultsshow that the accuracy of our prediction for the contents need to be cached inthe areas of the self-driving car is achieved at 98.04% and our approach canminimize delay.\n",

While thetraditional operations of the car-sharing service highly relied on humanengagements in fleet management, modern car-sharing platforms let users uploadcar images before and after their use to inspect the cars without a physicalvisit. To automate the aforementioned inspection task, prior approachesutilized deep neural networks. They commonly employed pre-training, a de-factotechnique to establish an effective model under the limited number of labeleddatasets. As candidate practitioners who deal with car images would presumablyget suffered from the lack of a labeled dataset, we analyzed a sophisticatedanalogy into the effectiveness of pre-training is important. However, priorstudies primarily shed a little spotlight on the effectiveness of pre-training.Motivated by the aforementioned lack of analysis, our study proposes a seriesof analyses to unveil the effectiveness of various pre-training methods inimage recognition tasks at the car-sharing platform. We set two real-worldimage recognition tasks in the car-sharing platform in a live service,established them under the many-shot and few-shot problem settings, andscrutinized which pre-training method accomplishes the most effectiveperformance in which setting. Furthermore, we analyzed how does thepre-training and fine-tuning convey different knowledge to the neural networksfor a precise understanding.\n",

We apply the Huygens-Fresnel Wave-based ElectricField Superposition (HF-WEFS) method combined with the radiating dipoleapproximation to compute the effects of scattering-induced distortions of focalexcitation fields on the far-field CARS signal. We analyze the effect ofspherical scatterers, placed in the vicinity of the focal volume, on the CARSsignal emitted by different objects (2{\\mu}m diameter solid sphere, 2{\\mu}mdiameter myelin cylinder and 2{\\mu}m diameter myelin tube). We find thatdistortions in the CARS signals arise not only from attenuation of the focalfield but also from scattering-induced changes in the spatial phase thatmodifies the angular distribution of the CARS emission. Our simulations furthershow that CARS signal attenuation can be minimized by using a high numericalaperture condenser. Moreover, unlike the CARS intensity image, CARS imagesformed by taking the ratio of CARS signals obtained using x- and y-polarizedinput fields is relatively insensitive to the effects of spherical scatterers.Our computational framework provide a mechanistic approach to characterizingscattering-induced distortions in coherent imaging of turbid media and mayinspire bottom-up approaches for adaptive optical methods for image correction.\n",

The acceleration $a(t)$ is heldapproximately constant for a certain time interval, followed by a jump to a newacceleration. These jumps seem to include a deterministic and a randomcomponent; the time $T$ between subsequent jumps is random, too. This leads toa dynamic, that never reaches a fixed-point ($a(t) \\to 0$ and velocitydifference to the car in front $\\Delta v \\to 0$) of the car-following dynamics.The existence of such a fixed-point is predicted by most of the existingcar-following theories.

Behaviour of cars is defined by conditional probability of carvelocity depending on the distance and velocity of the car ahead. A systemconsisting of different cars is modelled by a system of two types of carsdiffering in maximal velocity or efficiency of brakes. Starting fromconditional probabilities and using principle of maximum entropy, probabilitydensities of car velocities and headways are calculated. It is shown that thefirst-order phase transition between free flow and congested traffic may bedriven by number of fast cars in a system of slow cars, and, as a rule,admixture of cars of superior qualities does not increase but decreases thetotal flow. In the system of cars with poor brakes platoons of cars of the samevelocity are formed. They are dissolved by a small addition of cars with goodbrakes.

      "Texte : Crowding on train cars is a common problem plaguing the major public transitagencies around the world. On one hand a crowded train car presents a negativeexperience for the passengers, while on the other hand it indicatedinefficiencies in the train system. The Federal Transit Agency is interested inreducing the crowding level on public transit train cars. Automatic passengercounters (APC) are commonly used to count the passengers boarding and alightingthe train cars. Advanced APC solutions are available based on EO/IR sensors andvisual object detection technology, but are considerably expensive for largescale deployment. This report discusses a low-cost approach to APC by usingaccelerometer measurements from train car to estimate approximate passengerloading. Accelerometer sensor can measure train car vibration as the trainmoves along the rail tracks. The train car vibration changes with the passengerloading on the car. Detecting this change in vibration pattern with changingpassenger loading level is key to the accelerometer based APC solution.Moreover, accelerometer sensors present a low-cost APC solution compared toexisting EO/IR based APCs. This work presents a (i) theoretical model analysis(ii) experimental data driven approach to demonstrate the feasibility of usingaccelerometer for passenger loading estimation.\n",

These were common for a time on higher end American cars in the 60s/70s and came on when both headlight and turn signal were on. Today I think only BMW does it on some models.Fender turn signal indicators, I recall these best on the '64-66 Thunderbird. Amber lights on the top front corners of the front fenders. They served as both turn signal indicators that were more visible than versions on the dash. And also as an indicator visible to a driver in another vehicle alongside.And all add one other just because I think it'll be most of the replies to head it off. Physical knobs/buttons instead of touchscreen everything. Personally I think a mix of both is ideal.\n",

However, with the increasing burden of expanding populations andrapid urbanization in recent decades, public transportation systems and freighttraffic are suffering huge pressure, plaguing local governments and strainingeconomies. Engineers and researchers have started to re-examine, propose, anddevelop the underused near-ground spaces (NGS) for transportation purposes. Forinstance, flying cars, which are not a totally novel idea, aim at solving thetraffic congestion problem and releasing the strains on existing city transportnetworks by utilizing unoccupied NGS. Flying cars differ from traditionalgrounded transportation systems that are entirely limited by their physicalspace, such as trains on tracks or automobiles on roads. Flying cars do notoccupy or compete for high-altitude spaces used by air traffic forlong-distance transfer. However, there is a clear lack of specific literatureon flying cars and flying car transportation systems (FCTS), which this paperaims to address by describing modern advances, techniques, and challenges ofFCTS. We explore the inherent nature of NGS transportation and devise usefulproposals to facilitate the construction and commercialization of FCTS.

To reducecarbon emissions from the passenger car sector, both countries have consideredvarious policy levers affecting fuel prices, car prices and fuel economy. Thisstudy estimates the responsiveness of new car buyers in China and India to suchpolicy levers and drivers including income. Furthermore, we estimate thepotential for rebound effect and the effectiveness of a feebate policy. Toaccomplish this, we developed a joint discrete-continuous model of car choiceand usage based on revealed preference survey data from approximately 8000 newcar buyers from India and China who purchased cars in 2016-17. Conditional onbuying a new car, the fuel consumption in both markets is found to berelatively unresponsive to fuel price and income, with magnitudes of elasticityestimates ranging from 0.12 to 0.15. For both markets, the mean segment-leveldirect elasticities of fuel consumption relative to car price and fuel economyrange from 0.57 to 0.65. The rebound effect on fuel savings due to cost-freefuel economy improvement is found to be 17.1% for India and 18.8% for China. Arevenue-neutral feebate policy, with average rebates and fees of up to around15% of the retail price, resulted in fuel savings of around 0.7% for bothmarkets. While the feebate policy's rebound effect is low - 7.3% for India and1.6% for China - it does not appear to be an effective fuel conservationpolicy.\n",

      "Texte : Current technology for autonomous cars primarily focuses on getting thepassenger from point A to B. Nevertheless, it has been shown that passengersare afraid of taking a ride in self-driving cars. One way to alleviate thisproblem is by allowing the passenger to give natural language commands to thecar. However, the car can misunderstand the issued command or the visualsurroundings which could lead to uncertain situations. It is desirable that theself-driving car detects these situations and interacts with the passenger tosolve them. This paper proposes a model that detects uncertain situations whena command is given and finds the visual objects causing it. Optionally, aquestion generated by the system describing the uncertain objects is included.We argue that if the car could explain the objects in a human-like way,passengers could gain more confidence in the car's abilities. Thus, weinvestigate how to (1) detect uncertain situations and their underlying causes,and (2) how to generate clarifying questions for the passenger. When evaluatingon the Talk2Car dataset, we show that the proposed model, \\acrfull{pipeline},improves \\gls{m:ambiguous-absolute-increase} in terms of $IoU_{.5}$ compared tonot using \\gls{pipeline}. Furthermore, we designed a referring expressiongenerator (REG) \\acrfull{reg_model} tailored to a self-driving car settingwhich yields a relative improvement of \\gls{m:meteor-relative} METEOR and\\gls{m:rouge-relative} ROUGE-l compared with state-of-the-art REG models, andis three times faster.\n",

The overall continuum emission distribution at 4.8GHz is similar to that at lower frequencies. For Car I, two compact sources arerevealed that are likely to be young HII regions associated with triggered starformation. These results provide the first evidence of ongoing star formationin the northern region of the nebula. A close association between Car I and themolecular gas is consistent with a scenario in which Car I is currently carvingout a cavity within the northern molecular cloud. The complicated kinematicsassociated with Car II point to expansion from at least two different centres.All that is left of the molecular cloud in this region are clumps of dense gasand dust which are likely to be responsible for shaping the striking morphologyof the Car II components.\n",

To me, this is such a meaningless critique, since I don't drive around constantly fondling my interior plastics.  For example, people buy Evos and STis for the power and handling without a care in the world for interior quality.  99 percent of the time, the items I am interacting with aren't cheap plastics (seat, shift knob, steering wheel).  But I realize that others may have different tastes.  So I'm curious if there is anyone on here that was really loving a certain car but turned it down simply because the interior plastics were cheap and if so what car was it?\n",

Therefore, the riseof used cars sales is exponentially increasing. Car sellers sometimes takeadvantage of this scenario by listing unrealistic prices owing to the demand.Therefore, arises a need for a model that can assign a price for a vehicle byevaluating its features taking the prices of other cars into consideration. Inthis paper, we use supervised learning method namely Random Forest to predictthe prices of used cars. The model has been chosen after careful exploratorydata analysis to determine the impact of each feature on price. A Random Forestwith 500 Decision Trees were created to train the data. From experimentalresults, the training accuracy was found out to be 95.82%, and the testingaccuracy was 83.63%.

      "Texte : A rather simple car driving simulator was created based on the available opensource engine TORCS and used to analyze the basic features of human behavior incar driving within the car-following setups. Eight subjects with differentskill in driving real cars participated in these experiments. They wereinstructed to drive a virtual car without overtaking the lead car driven bycomputer at a fixed speed and not to lose sight of it. Moreover, theseexperiments were conducted with four different speed including 60km/h, 80km/h,100km/h, and 120km/h. Based on the collected data the distribution of theheadway, velocity, acceleration, and jerk are constructed and compared withavailable experimental data collected previously by the analysis of the realtraffic flow. A new model for car-following is proposed capture the foundproperties. As the main results we draw a conclusion that the human behavior incar driving should be categorized as a generalized intermittent control withnoise-driven activation of the active phase. Besides, we hypothesize that theextended phase space required for modeling human actions in car driving has tocomprise four phase variables, namely, the headway distance, the velocity ofcar, its acceleration, and the car jerk, i.e., the time derivative of the caracceleration. This time, the time pattern of pedal pushing and the distributionof time derivative of pedal was utilized in addition to previous variables.Moreover, all subjects' driving data were categorized as some styles with theirshapes.\n",

      "Texte : This paper presents a method for learning And-Or models to represent contextand occlusion for car detection and viewpoint estimation. The learned And-Ormodel represents car-to-car context and occlusion configurations at threelevels: (i) spatially-aligned cars, (ii) single car under different occlusionconfigurations, and (iii) a small number of parts. The And-Or model embeds agrammar for representing large structural and appearance variations in areconfigurable hierarchy. The learning process consists of two stages in aweakly supervised way (i.e., only bounding boxes of single cars are annotated).Firstly, the structure of the And-Or model is learned with three components:(a) mining multi-car contextual patterns based on layouts of annotated singlecar bounding boxes, (b) mining occlusion configurations between single cars,and (c) learning different combinations of part visibility based on car 3D CADsimulation. The And-Or model is organized in a directed and acyclic graph whichcan be inferred by Dynamic Programming. Secondly, the model parameters (forappearance, deformation and bias) are jointly trained using Weak-LabelStructural SVM. In experiments, we test our model on four car detectiondatasets --- the KITTI dataset \\cite{Geiger12}, the PASCAL VOC2007 cardataset~\\cite{pascal}, and two self-collected car datasets, namely theStreet-Parking car dataset and the Parking-Lot car dataset, and three datasetsfor car viewpoint estimation --- the PASCAL VOC2006 car dataset~\\cite{pascal},the 3D car dataset~\\cite{savarese}, and the PASCAL3D+ cardataset~\\cite{xiang_wacv14}.

The total car density $\\rho_o$ and the exitprobability $\\alpha$ are the two control parameters. At the transition, thenumber of parked cars $N_p$ diverges in both cases, with the length of the road$N_s$, as $N_p\\sim N_s^{y_p}$ with $y_p=1/2$.

      "Texte : As an adoptive cellular therapy, Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell (CART-cell) therapy has shown remarkable success in hematological malignancies, butonly limited efficacy against solid tumors. Compared with blood cancers, solidtumors present a unique set of challenges that ultimately neutralize thefunction of CAR T-cells. One such barrier is antigen heterogeneity -variability in the expression of the antigen on tumor cells. Success of CART-cell therapy in solid tumors is unlikely unless almost all the tumor cellsexpress the specific antigen that CAR T-cells target. A critical question forsolving the heterogeneity problem is whether CAR T therapy induces bystandereffects, such as antigen spreading. Antigen spreading occurs when CAR T-cellsactivate other endogenous antitumor CD8 T cells against antigens that were notoriginally targeted. In this work, we develop a mathematical model of CART-cell therapy for solid tumors that takes into consideration both antigenheterogeneity and bystander effects. Our model is based on in vivo treatmentdata that includes a mixture of target antigen-positive and targetantigen-negative tumor cells. We use our model to simulate large cohorts ofvirtual patients to gain a better understanding of the relationship betweenbystander killing. We also investigate several strategies for enhancing thebystander effect and thus increasing the overall efficacy of CAR T-cell therapyfor solid tumor.\n",

This metricallows comparison of efficiencies of cars with different masses and fuel types.It is as useful to quantify efficiencies of cars as the concept of dragcoefficient is to quantify the efficacy of their aerodynamic shapes.

Utilising robust tools and machine learning frameworks, we design andimplement a flexible car parking environment in the form of a Markov decisionprocess with independent learners, exploiting multi-agent communication. Weimplement a suite of tools to perform experiments at scale, obtaining modelsparking up to 7 cars with over a 98.1% success rate, significantly beatingexisting single-agent models. We also obtain several results relating tocompetitive and collaborative behaviours exhibited by the cars in ourenvironment, with varying densities and levels of communication. Notably, wediscover a form of collaboration that cannot arise without competition, and a'leaky' form of collaboration whereby agents collaborate without sufficientstate.

      "Texte : In parking problems, a given number of cars enter a one-way streetsequentially, and try to park according to a specified preferred spot in thestreet. Various models are possible depending on the chosen rule forcollisions, when two cars have the same preferred spot. In classical parkingfunctions, if a car's preferred spot is already occupied by a previous car, itdrives forward and looks for the first unoccupied spot to park. In this work,we introduce a variant of classical parking functions, called \"friendshipparking functions\", which imposes additional restrictions on where cars canpark. Namely, a car can only end up parking next to cars which are its friends(friendship will correspond to adjacency in an underlying graph). Wecharacterise and enumerate such friendship parking functions according to theiroutcome permutation, which describes the final configuration when all cars haveparked. We apply this to the case where the underlying friendship graph is thecycle graph. Finally, we consider a subset of classical parking functions,called \"cyclic parking functions\", where cars end up in an increasing cyclicorder. We enumerate these cyclic parking functions and exhibit a bijection topermutation components.\n",

In this study we propose asimple method to enable systematic conversions between higher-order continuumand car-following models in two steps: equivalent transformations of variablesbetween Eulerian and Lagrangian coordinates, and finite differenceapproximations of first-order derivatives in Lagrangian coordinates. With themethod, we derive higher-order continuum models from a number of well-knowncar-following models. We also derive car-following models from higher-ordercontinuum models. For general second-order models, we demonstrate that thecar-following and continuum formulations share the same fundamental diagram,but the string stability condition of a car-following model is different fromthe linear stability condition of a continuum model.

      "Texte : We clarify relationships between conditional (CAR) and simultaneous (SAR)autoregressive models. We review the literature on this topic and find that itis mostly incomplete. Our main result is that a SAR model can be written as aunique CAR model, and while a CAR model can be written as a SAR model, it isnot unique. In fact, we show how any multivariate Gaussian distribution on afinite set of points with a positive-definite covariance matrix can be writtenas either a CAR or a SAR model. We illustrate how to obtain any number of SARcovariance matrices from a single CAR covariance matrix by using Givensrotation matrices on a simulated example. We also discuss sparseness in theoriginal CAR construction, and for the resulting SAR weights matrix. For a realexample, we use crime data in 49 neighborhoods from Columbus, Ohio, and showthat a geostatistical model optimizes the likelihood much better than typicalfirst-order CAR models. We then use the implied weights from the geostatisticalmodel to estimate CAR model parameters that provides the best overalloptimization.\n",

      "Texte : Car-hailing services have become a prominent data source for urban trafficstudies. Extracting useful information from car-hailing trace data is essentialfor effective traffic management, while discrepancies between car-hailingvehicles and urban traffic should be considered. This paper proposes a genericframework for estimating and analyzing urban traffic patterns using car-hailingtrace data. The framework consists of three layers: the data layer, theinteractive software layer, and the processing method layer. By pre-processingcar-hailing GPS trace data with operations such as data cutting, map matching,and trace correction, the framework generates tensor matrices that estimatetraffic patterns for car-hailing vehicle flow and average road speed. Ananalysis block based on these matrices examines the relationships anddifferences between car-hailing vehicles and urban traffic patterns, which havebeen overlooked in previous research. Experimental results demonstrate theeffectiveness of the proposed framework in examining temporal-spatial patternsof car-hailing vehicles and urban traffic. For temporal analysis, urban roadtraffic displays a bimodal characteristic while car-hailing flow exhibits a'multi-peak' pattern, fluctuating significantly during holidays and thusgenerating a hierarchical structure. For spatial analysis, the heat mapsgenerated from the matrices exhibit certain discrepancies, but the spatialdistribution of hotspots and vehicle aggregation areas remains similar.\n",

      "Texte : The usability of ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft has beenconsiderably improved by advancements in cellular communications. Such atech-driven transportation system can reduce the number of private cars, inroads with limited physical capacity, effectively match drivers with passengersrequesting service, and save drivers and passengers time by optimal schedulingand estimating of the trips. However, the existing services offered byride-sharing companies may not necessarily reduce congestion, if they are notequitably accessed in urban areas. This paper addresses this important issue byclassifying cars as ride-sharing and non-ride-sharing cars and developing anovel dissensus-based traffic evolution dynamics to effectively model theirdistribution in a shared network of interconnected roads (NOIR). This newdynamics models the ride-sharing car evolution as a non-stationary Markovprocess with uncertainty matrices decomposed into outflow and tendencyprobability matrices, where outflow probabilities are constrained by thenon-ride-sharing cars behavior, but the tendency probabilities are consideredas decision variables (or distributed controls) for achieving an equitabledistribution of ride-sharing cars in a congested traffic.\n",

We show that $EX$ isfinite at the critical threshold, describe its growth rate above criticality,and prove that it increases as the initial car arrival distribution becomesless concentrated.

      "Texte : This article deals with the specific context of an autonomous car navigatingin an urban center within a shared space between pedestrians and cars. Thedriver delegates the control to the autonomous system while remaining seated inthe driver's seat. The proposed study aims at giving a first insight into thedefinition of human perception of space applied to vehicles by testing theexistence of a personal space around the car.It aims at measuring proxemicinformation about the driver's comfort zone in such conditions.Proxemics, orhuman perception of space, has been largely explored when applied to humans orto robots, leading to the concept of personal space, but poorly when applied tovehicles. In this article, we highlight the existence and the characteristicsof a zone of comfort around the car which is not correlated to the risk of acollision between the car and other road users. Our experiment includes 19volunteers using a virtual reality headset to look at 30 scenarios filmed in360{\\textdegree} from the point of view of a passenger sitting in the driver'sseat of an autonomous car.They were asked to say \"stop\" when they feltdiscomfort visualizing the scenarios.As said, the scenarios voluntarily avoidcollision effect as we do not want to measure fear but discomfort.The scenariosinvolve one or three pedestrians walking past the car at different distancesfrom the wings of the car, relative to the direction of motion of the car, onboth sides. The car is either static or moving straight forward at differentspeeds.The results indicate the existence of a comfort zone around the car inwhich intrusion causes discomfort.The size of the comfort zone is sensitiveneither to the side of the car where the pedestrian passes nor to the number ofpedestrians. In contrast, the feeling of discomfort is relative to the car'smotion (static or moving).Another outcome from this study is an illustration ofthe usage of first person 360{\\textdegree} video and a virtual reality headsetto evaluate feelings of a passenger within an autonomous car.\n",

The precise terms of such a treatment are stated withinthe privacy policies accepted by the user when buying a car or through theinfotainment system when it is first started. This paper uses a double lens toassess people's privacy while they drive a car. The first approach is objectiveand studies the readability of privacy policies that comes with cars. Weanalyse the privacy policies of twelve car brands and apply well-knownreadability indices to evaluate the extent to which privacy policies arecomprehensible by all drivers. The second approach targets drivers' opinions toextrapolate their privacy concerns and trust perceptions. We design aquestionnaire to collect the opinions of 88 participants and draw essentialstatistics about them. Our combined findings indicate that privacy isinsufficiently understood at present as an issue deriving from driving a car,hence future technologies should be tailored to make people more aware of theissue and to enable them to express their preferences.\n",

      "Texte : Physical fluents, a term originally used by Newton [40], refers totime-varying object states in dynamic scenes. In this paper, we are interestedin inferring the fluents of vehicles from video. For example, a door (hood,trunk) is open or closed through various actions, light is blinking to turn.Recognizing these fluents has broad applications, yet have received scantattention in the computer vision literature. Car fluent recognition entails aunified framework for car detection, car part localization and part statusrecognition, which is made difficult by large structural and appearancevariations, low resolutions and occlusions. This paper learns aspatial-temporal And-Or hierarchical model to represent car fluents. Thelearning of this model is formulated under the latent structural SVM framework.Since there are no publicly related dataset, we collect and annotate a carfluent dataset consisting of car videos with diverse fluents. In experiments,the proposed method outperforms several highly related baseline methods interms of car fluent recognition and car part localization.\n",

      "Texte : Based on an embedding formula of the CAR algebra into the Cuntz algebra${\\mathcal O}_{2^p}$, properties of the CAR algebra are studied in detail byrestricting those of the Cuntz algebra. Various $\\ast$-endomorphisms of theCuntz algebra are explicitly constructed, and transcribed into those of the CARalgebra. In particular, a set of $\\ast$-endomorphisms of the CAR algebra intoits even subalgebra are constructed. According to branching formulae, which areobtained by composing representations and $\\ast$-endomorphisms, it is shownthat a KMS state of the CAR algebra is obtained through the above even-CARendomorphisms from the Fock representation. A $U(2^p)$ action on ${\\mathcalO}_{2^p}$ induces $\\ast$-automorphisms of the CAR algebra, which are given bynonlinear transformations expressed in terms of polynomials in generators. Itis shown that, among such $\\ast$-automorphisms of the CAR algebra, there existsa family of one-parameter groups of $\\ast$-automorphisms describing timeevolutions of fermions, in which the particle number of the system changes bytime while the Fock vacuum is kept invariant.\n",

      "Texte : Car sharing is expected to reduce traffic congestion and pollution in citieswhile at the same time improving accessibility to public transport. However,the most popular form of car sharing, one-way car sharing, still suffers fromthe vehicle unbalance problem. Innovative solutions to this issue rely oncustom vehicles with stackable capabilities: customers or operators can drive atrain of vehicles if necessary, thus efficiently bringing several cars from anarea with few requests to an area with many requests. However, how to model acar sharing system with stackable vehicles is an open problem in the relatedliterature. In this paper, we propose a queueing theoretical model to fill thisgap, and we use this model to derive an upper-bound on user-based relocationcapabilities. We also validate, for the first time in the related literature,legacy queueing theoretical models against a trace of real car sharing data.Finally, we present preliminary results about the impact, on car availability,of simple user-based relocation heuristics with stackable vehicles. Our resultsindicate that user-based relocation schemes that exploit vehicle stackabilitycan significantly improve car availability at stations.\n",

      "Texte : Idling vehicles waste energy and pollute the environment through exhaustemission. In some countries, idling a vehicle for more than a predefinedduration is prohibited and automatic idling vehicle detection is desirable forlaw enforcement. We propose the first automatic system to detect idling cars,using infrared (IR) imaging and deep networks.  We rely on the differences in spatio-temporal heat signatures of idling andstopped cars and monitor the car temperature with a long-wavelength IR camera.We formulate the idling car detection problem as spatio-temporal eventdetection in IR image sequences and employ deep networks for spatio-temporalmodeling. We collected the first IR image sequence dataset for idling cardetection. First, we detect the cars in each IR image using a convolutionalneural network, which is pre-trained on regular RGB images and fine-tuned on IRimages for higher accuracy. Then, we track the detected cars over time toidentify the cars that are parked. Finally, we use the 3D spatio-temporal IRimage volume of each parked car as input to convolutional and recurrentnetworks to classify them as idling or not. We carried out an extensiveempirical evaluation of temporal and spatio-temporal modeling approaches withvarious convolutional and recurrent architectures. We present promisingexperimental results on our IR image sequence dataset.\n",

      "Texte : Autonomous cars can perform poorly for many reasons. They may have perceptionissues, incorrect dynamics models, be unaware of obscure rules of human trafficsystems, or follow certain rules too conservatively. Regardless of the exactfailure mode of the car, often human drivers around the car are behavingcorrectly. For example, even if the car does not know that it should pull overwhen an ambulance races by, other humans on the road will know and will pullover. We propose to make socially cohesive cars that leverage the behavior ofnearby human drivers to act in ways that are safer and more sociallyacceptable. The simple intuition behind our algorithm is that if all the humansare consistently behaving in a particular way, then the autonomous car probablyshould too. We analyze the performance of our algorithm in a variety ofscenarios and conduct a user study to assess people's attitudes towardssocially cohesive cars. We find that people are surprisingly tolerant ofmistakes that cohesive cars might make in order to get the benefits of drivingin a car with a safer, or even just more socially acceptable behavior.\n",

Four subjects with different skillin driving real cars participated in these experiments. The subjects wereinstructed to drive a car without overtaking and losing sight of a lead cardriven by computer at a fixed speed. Based on the collected data thedistributions of the headway distance, the car velocity, acceleration, and jerkare constructed and compared with the available experimental data for the realtraffic flow. A new model for the car-following is proposed to capture thefound properties. As the main result, we draw a conclusion that human actionsin car driving should be categorized as generalized intermittent control withnoise-driven activation. Besides, we hypothesize that the car jerk togetherwith the car acceleration are additional phase variables required fordescribing the dynamics of car motion governed by human drivers.\n",

We show that the Toeplitz CAR flowscontain uncountably many mutually non cocycle conjugate E_0-semigroups of typeIII. We also generalize the type III criterion for Toeplitz CAR flows employedby Powers (and later refined by W. Arveson), and show that Toeplitz CAR flowsare always either of type I or type III.\n",

      "Texte : The problem of a car following a lead car driven with constant velocity isconsidered. To derive the governing equations for the following car dynamics acost functional that ranks the outcomes of different driving strategies isconstructed, which applies to fairly general properties of the driver behavior.Assuming the driver behavior to be rational, the existence of the Nashequilibrium is proved. Rational driving is defined by supposing that a drivercorrects continuously the car motion to follow the optimal path minimizing thecost functional. The corresponding car-following dynamics is described quitegenerally by a boundary value problem based on the obtained extremal equations.Linearization of these equations around the stationary state results in ageneralization of the widely used optimal velocity model. Moreover, it is shownthat there are conditions (the ``dense traffic'' limit) under which therational car dynamics comprises two stages, fast and slow. During the faststage a driver eliminates the velocity difference between the cars, thesubsequent slow stage optimizes the headway. In the ``dense traffic'' limit aneffective Hamiltonian description is constructed. This allows a more detailednonlinear analysis. Finally, the differences between rational and boundedrational driver behavior are discussed. The latter, in particular, justifiessome basic assumptions used recently by the authors to construct acar-following model lying beyond the frameworks of rationality.\n",

Propertiesof the region of critical changes, so-called jamming transition parameters, aredescribed in details. The basic model, modified by the assumption that for eachcar an individual velocity limit is assigned, is investigated in the aim tofind the best supplementary rule allowing the jammed traffic to move withvelocity larger than the slowest driving vehicle.\n",

      "Texte : We study completely asymmetric 2-channel exclusion processes in 1 dimension.It describes a two-way traffic flow with cars moving in opposite directions.The interchannel interaction makes cars slow down in the vicinity ofapproaching cars in other lane. Particularly, we consider in detail the systemwith a finite density of cars on one lane and a single car on the other one.  When the interchannel interaction reaches a critical value, traffic jamoccurs, which turns out to be of first order phase transition. We derive exactexpressions for the average velocities, the current, the density profile andthe $k$- point density correlation functions. We also obtain the exactprobability of two cars in one lane being distance $R$ apart, provided there isa finite density of cars on the other lane, and show the two cars form a weaklybound state in the jammed phase.\n",

      "Texte : Computer-generated imagery of car models has become an indispensable part ofcar manufacturers' advertisement concepts. They are for instance used in carconfigurators to offer customers the possibility to configure their car onlineaccording to their personal preferences. However, human-led quality assurancefaces the challenge to keep up with high-volume visual inspections due to thecar models' increasing complexity. Even though the application of machinelearning to many visual inspection tasks has demonstrated great success, itsneed for large labeled data sets remains a central barrier to using suchsystems in practice. In this paper, we propose an active machine learning-basedquality assurance system that requires significantly fewer labeled instances toidentify defective virtual car renderings without compromising performance. Byemploying our system at a German automotive manufacturer, start-up difficultiescan be overcome, the inspection process efficiency can be increased, and thuseconomic advantages can be realized.\n",

      "Texte : Current challenges of car manufacturers are to make roads safe, to achievefree flowing traffic with few congestions, and to reduce pollution by aneffective fuel use. To reach these goals, many improvements are performedin-car, but more and more approaches rely on connected cars with communicationcapabilities between cars, with an infrastructure, or with IoT devices.Monitoring and coordinating vehicles allow then to compute intelligent ways oftransportation. Connected cars have introduced a new way of thinking cars - notonly as a mean for a driver to go from A to B, but as smart cars - a userextension like the smartphone today. In this report, we introduce concepts andspecific vocabulary in order to classify current innovations or ideas on theemerging topic of smart car. We present a graphical categorization showing thisevolution in function of the societal evolution. Different perspectives areadopted: a vehicle-centric view, a vehicle-network view, and a user-centricview; described by simple and complex use-cases and illustrated by a list ofemerging and current projects from the academic and industrial worlds. Weidentified an empty space in innovation between the user and his car:paradoxically even if they are both in interaction, they are separated throughdifferent application uses. Future challenge is to interlace social concerns ofthe user within an intelligent and efficient driving.\n",

      "Texte : The proliferation of car sharing services in recent years presents apromising avenue for advancing sustainable transportation. Beyond merelyreducing car ownership rates, these systems can play a pivotal role inbolstering grid stability through the provision of ancillary services viavehicle-to-grid (V2G) technologies - a facet that has received limitedattention in previous research. In this study, we analyze the potential of V2Gin car sharing by designing future scenarios for a national-scale service inSwitzerland. We propose an agent-based simulation pipeline that considerspopulation changes as well as different business strategies of the car sharingservice, and we demonstrate its successful application for simulating scenariosfor 2030. To imitate car sharing user behavior, we develop a data-driven modechoice model. Our analysis reveals important differences in the examinedscenarios, such as higher vehicle utilization rates for a reduced fleet size aswell as in a scenario featuring new car sharing stations. These disparitiestranslate into variations in the power flexibility of the fleet available forancillary services, ranging from 12 to 50 MW, depending on the scenario and thetime of the day. Furthermore, we conduct a case study involving a subset of thecar sharing fleet, incorporating real-world electricity pricing data. The casestudy substantiates the existence of a sweet spot involving monetary gains forboth power grid operators and fleet owners. Our findings provide guidelines todecision makers and underscore the pressing need for regulatory enhancementsconcerning power trading within the realm of car sharing.\n",

      "Texte : Coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscope system was built andapplied to a non-intrusive gas concentration measurement of a mixing flow in amillimeter-scale channel. Carbon dioxide and nitrogen were chosen as testfluids and CARS signals from the fluids were generated by adjusting thewavelengths of the Pump and the Stokes beams. The generated CARS signals, whosewavelengths are different from those of the Pump and the Stokes beams, werecaptured by an EM-CCD camera after filtering out the excitation beams. Acalibration experiment was performed in order to confirm the applicability ofthe built-up CARS system by measuring the intensity of the CARS signal fromknown concentrations of the samples. After confirming that the measured CARSintensity was proportional to the second power of the concentrations as wastheoretically predicted, the CARS intensities in the gas mixing flow channelwere measured. Ten different measurement points were set and concentrations ofboth carbon dioxide and nitrogen at each point were obtained. Consequently, itwas observed that the mixing of two fluids progressed as the measurement pointmoved downstream. The results show the applicability of CARS to thenon-intrusive concentration measurement of gas flows without any preprocesssuch as gas absorption into liquid or solid.\n",

      "Texte : We consider two variations of the discrete car parking problem where at everyvertex of the integers a car arrives with rate one, now allowing for parking intwo lines. a) The car parks in the first line whenever the vertex and all ofits nearest neighbors are not occupied yet. It can reach the first line if itis not obstructed by cars already parked in the second line (screening). b) Thecar parks according to the same rules, but parking in the first line can not beobstructed by parked cars in the second line (no screening). In both models, acar that can not park in the first line will attempt to park in the secondline. If it is obstructed in the second line as well, the attempt is discarded.We show that both models are solvable in terms of finite-dimensional ODEs. Wecompare numerically the limits of first and second line densities, with timegoing to infinity. While it is not surprising that model a) exhibits anincrease of the density in the second line from the first line, more remarkablythis is also true for model b), albeit in a less pronounced way.\n",

      "Texte : In the field of car evaluation, more and more netizens choose to expresstheir opinions on the Internet platform, and these comments will affect thedecision-making of buyers and the trend of car word-of-mouth. As an importantbranch of natural language processing (NLP), sentiment analysis provides aneffective research method for analyzing the sentiment types of massive carreview texts. However, due to the lexical professionalism and large text noiseof review texts in the automotive field, when a general sentiment analysismodel is applied to car reviews, the accuracy of the model will be poor. Toovercome these above challenges, we aim at the sentiment analysis task of carreview texts. From the perspective of word vectors, pre-training is carried outby means of whole word mask of proprietary vocabulary in the automotive field,and then training data is carried out through the strategy of an adversarialtraining set. Based on this, we propose a car review text sentiment analysismodel based on adversarial training and whole word mask BERT(ATWWM-BERT).\n",

      "Texte : We consider a system of ordered cars moving in $\\R$ from right to left.  Each car is represented by a point in $\\R$; two or more cars can occupy thesame point but cannot overpass. Cars have two possible velocities: either 0 or1. An unblocked car needs an exponential random time of mean 1 to pass fromspeed 0 to speed 1 (\\emph{slow-to-start}). Car $i$, say, travels at speed 1until it (possibly) hits the stopped car $i-1$ to its left. After the departureof car $i-1$, car $i$ waits an exponential random time to change its speed to1, travels at this speed until it hits again stopped car $i-1$ and so on.Initially cars are distributed in $\\R$ according to a Poisson process ofparameter $\\lambda<1$. We show that every car will be stopped only a finitenumber of times and that the final relative car positions is again a Poissonprocess with parameter $\\lambda$. To do that, we relate the trajectories of thecars to a $M/M/1$ stationary queue as follows. Space in the traffic model istime for the queue. The initial positions of the cars coincide with the arrivalprocess of the queue and the final relative car positions match the departureprocess of the queue.\n",

      "Texte : Autonomous cars are well known for being vulnerable to adversarial attacksthat can compromise the safety of the car and pose danger to other road users.To effectively defend against adversaries, it is required to not only testautonomous cars for finding driving errors but to improve the robustness of thecars to these errors. To this end, in this paper, we propose a two-stepmethodology for autonomous cars that consists of (i) finding failure states inautonomous cars by training the adversarial driving agent, and (ii) improvingthe robustness of autonomous cars by retraining them with effective adversarialinputs. Our methodology supports testing autonomous cars in a multi-agentenvironment, where we train and compare adversarial car policy on two customreward functions to test the driving control decision of autonomous cars. Werun experiments in a vision-based high-fidelity urban driving simulatedenvironment. Our results show that adversarial testing can be used for findingerroneous autonomous driving behavior, followed by adversarial training forimproving the robustness of deep reinforcement learning-based autonomousdriving policies. We demonstrate that the autonomous cars retrained using theeffective adversarial inputs noticeably increase the performance of theirdriving policies in terms of reduced collision and offroad steering errors.\n",

      "Texte : Hello there,So didn't need to wait 1 year for this review since my previous car was also an Alpine A110, albeit a \"Pure\" (entry-range trim) version.This previous car gave me a taste of trackdays and so I made the decision to stay within the Alpine brand but with a version better tailored for the occasional fun on track. Reddit review : [https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/vdobo3/18month\\_ownership\\_review\\_alpine\\_a110/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/vdobo3/18month_ownership_review_alpine_a110/)  A change of job made the switch possible, I went for a trade-in on the A110 for peace of mind and the value was alright.My first car ever was a ND Miata with the 1.5L engine and 6MT, very fun and I kinda miss it sometimes : [https://www.reddit.com/r/Miata/comments/dlzlb5/shes\\_here\\_first\\_car\\_and\\_first\\_miata\\_just\\_waiting/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Miata/comments/dlzlb5/shes_here_first_car_and_first_miata_just_waiting/)The A110 Pure was a great experience, plenty fun on the road (more on that below) and definitely the most bangs for your buck version, paid 61.5K‚Ç¨ for it new with the must-have options, didn't felt like a lot.# The specSo with a larger budget this time I went for :\\- Alpine Blue paint : really didn't want this at first, it's the most common so wanted something different when I first specced the car.  Thunder Gray felt a bit boring for the sporty spec I had in mind, Abyss Blue is too dark and wouldn't let the carbon bits shine, Fire Orange was too much for me. So only had limited Atelier paints left at 5000‚Ç¨, Emerald Green is sweet but felt more at home on a Lotus, and Montebello Gray was already sold out.  So went for Alpine Blue in the end since it's actually pretty stunning for its price (1800‚Ç¨), sporty without being too show-off, and light enough to let the carbon bits contrast nicely. Would be a nice contrast with the S-trim orange bits too.\\- Carbon aero kit : really gives a much sportier look, although can leave the car looking less \"smooth\" but wanted all the track-day related options as well as an as different spec as possible compared to my previous Alpine, since I was already buying the same car I wanted to differentiate it strongly. 5400‚Ç¨ option (6400‚Ç¨ now).  Gives more downforce too of course, although you need to be on fast tracks to really feel it I'd say, but at least it'll always reduce lift and therefore participate in the tight chassis experience.\\- Carbon roof : same as the aero kit, shaves off 1.8kg pretty high so good way to lower the CoG, also looks very good imo. 2400‚Ç¨ option (3400‚Ç¨ now).\\- Forged Fuchs wheels in titanium gray paint : lighter wheels available and best-looking to me, another 1.500‚Ç¨ or so.  Went for red calipers to avoid the standard S orange ones, didn't look that great to me.\\- Extended alcantara interior pack : replace almost all the leather (wheel, bucket seats, central piece, dash, roof lining) with Alcantara, looks more sporty, less glare and very nice to have on the steering wheel imo, 2.000‚Ç¨ or so.\\- Blacked out light up front and translucent lights on the rear : gives a meaner look up front and gives the same look as the R version on the rear, felt like a good choice to avoid the classic red color to get a smoother rear end visually.\\- Focal Premium audio : had the standard Focal in the previous one, sounded very good for a small sportcar sound system so went for the best version this time, adding a sub and a better amp. Definitely gives more oomph to the sound especially at highway speeds, without feeling bloated and unbalanced, one of the truly surprising thing is this little 1130kg two-seater.\\- Orange safety belts to lighten up the interior and merge better with the S trim orange bits. Also harness pre-setup installation. It adds attach points to make it very easy to install harnesses later on, planning on doing this before Spring since I plan on going to Spa for a track-day.\\- And of course 300hp and the S chassis setup, more on that below.Total OOTD price was around 96k‚Ç¨, so around 50% more than my previous Alpine.It ends up looking like this : [https://imgur.com/a/kKvDACX](https://imgur.com/a/kKvDACX)# As a dailyStarting with this because it's actually my only car hehe.So I already knew how great the Alpine could be as a do-all machine, but the S was supposed to be a bit too stiff for every day traffic and city roads.  Well one short test-drive was enough to find the S to be perfectly livable enough and 3500km later I don't regret the switch on the daily stuff.It's indeed a bit rougher at low speeds and on bad pavement, but the low weight (2490 pounds !!) still lets the S breathes nicely with the road, and it's actually even smoother when you're going rapidly as the sharper chassis gives you more confidence.Storage space is still low but OK for a week or two away if you pack accordingly.It's way better for long highway drives with the sharper chassis, it doesn't wobble as much as the standard A110 so you don't have to grip the wheel as firmly. You can cruise at 150km/h for hours in relative silence and most importantly in total confidence, whereas the normal A110 is a bit more worrying at high speed turns and gets unsettled even more when it's windy.The Focal Premium is a nice addition for long drives too, giving clear and powerful balanced sound rendition.The new cars also have CarPlay so a big plus with Waze and Apple Music on the center screen.Lastly, the aero kit front spoiler is not as troublesome as I feared, the Alpine has a pretty good ground clearance so I can still take speed bumps easily. Only some weird angles in underground parkings or country roads junctions have to be approached with caution, I already bruised the underside of the front lip twice, lightly.# On the roadSo, how fun is it then ?Well, very ! It's still that magical little sportcar that gives you ton of fun like the A110 Pure, only even better.Biggest differences are the front end, the body control, steering feel and sound.The chassis is lower and stiffer and you feel it every second. The front end is massive fun, reminds me of the Lotus Elise Cup 250 I tried a few years ago before buying the A110.Steering was a weakish point on the base car, but here it has both more weight and better feedback, definitely not regretting I didn't went with a Lotus now that I have the S. Still not as great an Elise mind you, but really pretty nice and better than the 718 S I tried on track before ordering the S.Body control is much tighter, the base car is known for its overdone body roll, giving it magical compliance on the worst roads but making the car a bit unfocused at high speed and on track.  The S really goes for more of a German sportcar setup but manages to mostly keep that uncanny compliance thanks to the low weight.Brakes are still awesome, I had the 320mm optional discs on the Pure and they come standard on the S. My favorite brakes in this price segment, as fun to use as the steering wheel of an Elise/Exige, they're very un-assisted and give you tons of feedback, perfect for trail-braking. Just have to remove the little plastic bits in front in order to get a decent-enough cooling for the front brakes. Definitely good enough for trackday beginners, of course if you go to Spa/Nurb once a month and have a great level you'll want better pads and coolant at least.And the sound is finally good enough for my ears, I have to remind you it's a small 1.8L turbo 4-cylinder engine equipped with all the funny European stuff (particle filters, catalyser etc.) so sounding good wasn't a given.  But it does sound pretty nice, the 300hp engine setup have a more agressive pop-and-bang soundtrack, and the cabin noises are still very fun with lots of turbo/induction sounds. The engine really screams nicely behind your head when over 3000rpm.Engine power is also up, giving more kick to the car, both in low end torque and high end peak power, so you can speed up in a stronger manner after some fun corners on country roads or just have more breath to pass at highway speeds.So in the end, even though it was tailored for track use I find it to be a better choice for me on the open road.# On the trackWell the differences are even greater on track, after all this particular spec is made for this and it's the best place to enjoy the tighter chassis.The best difference is how much more confident you are with the S, the chassis is really talking to you in a clearer way at track speeds compared to the base car.  The front end is epic, massive, solid, planted, agile, you can attack any corner with huge confidence in what's happening up front and what's going to happen throughout the whole turn.The base car you had to really load the front under braking to get something solid but you'd lose the rear in the process. Here with the S the whole car stays composed and the front end is just tons of pure fun.The additional power is mostly felt on track too (300hp vs 252 for the Pure), it stops losing wind after 5500 rpm like in the base car and you get peak hp up until 6500 rpm here so more fun to explore the top range.Did my first trackday in October once I reached 3000km and it was lots of fun, no problem with the brakes for now.I have the Michelin PS4 tires so not even the best ones for the track. They were OK but you can feel they overheat a bit so have to keep sessions at 15mn max so they can cool down. Would love to try Cup2's but bad choice for a daily in winter here.On-board track video : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nzR92cQxQI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nzR92cQxQI)Fastest lap is the 5th one. # What about the A110R ? And closing thoughts.The R version launched 6 months before I took delivery of my S (12 months total wait time oof), so naturally I had big questions about it. It's mostly even better than my S (did some laps with a R owner on track) but some critical points are making it a bad choice as an only car, plus it's pretty overpriced for the small performance delta you get versus an aero kit-equipped S.  I could have changed my order for an R since the car doesn't enter actual production before the final 8 weeks or so but decided not to in the end.The R has carbon wheels, fixed passenger-side carbon bucket seats, no rear windows (carbon cover instead), and only harnesses (no safety belts possible). No front/rear proximity sensors either, no subwoofer audio option. And it's 30k‚Ç¨ over the S.  The suspensions are brilliant too, and it does look even sportier (in a good way) to me. But the massive price delta doesn't get justified, press reviews only found a minimal lap time diff with a Cup2 aero kit S.Still I love the carbon bucket seats, the carbon bonnet, the carbon skirts and rear diffuser, I'll try to snag some R-bits for my S down the road then.Apart from that I plan on keeping this S for the next 4 years because changing cars every 18 months like I did prior to that has proven to be quite the financial ruin. So I'll baby this one and have fun with it for quite some time, and may invest in some mods once the warranty is gone like titanium exhaust, Ohlins dampers, track-oriented brake mods...Always loved Lotus too but the Emira isn't what I'm interested in. Next step if I had the buying power would be a 911 GT3 or 718 GT4/RS but pretty sure they're not as fun on the open road though, still planning on renting both the 992 GT3 and 718 GT4RS on track in the coming months just to see what's up.   But yeah a two-seater as light and fun and polyvalent as my current S will indeed be hard to replace in the future I fear, we'll see !Hope you enjoyed the read (long one tho I'm sorry), don't hesitate if you have questions or anything. I always take the time of writing review for these Alpines since they're not available in the US so I guess some of you are curious.  Sorry in advance for any grammatical mistake, been a long time since I've wrote a long text in English.\n",

      "Texte : Exact mean field equations are derived analytically to give the fundamentaldiagrams, i.e., the average speed - car density relations, for theFukui-Ishibashi one-dimensional traffic flow cellular automaton model of highspeed vehicles $(v_{max}=M>1) $ with stochastic delay. Starting with the basicequation describing the time evolution of the number of empty sites in front ofeach car, the concepts of inter-car spacings longer and shorter than $M$ areintroduced. The probabilities of having long and short spacings on the road arecalculated. For high car densities $(\\rho \\geq 1/M)$, it is shown thatinter-car spacings longer than $M$ will be shortened as the traffic flowevolves in time, and any initial configurations approach a steady state inwhich all the inter-car spacings are of the short type. Similarly for low cardensities $(\\rho \\leq 1/M)$, it can be shown that traffic flow approaches anasymptotic steady state in which all the inter-car spacings are longer than$M-2$. The average traffic speed is then obtained analytically as a function ofcar density in the asymptotic steady state. The fundamental diagram so obtainedis in excellent agreement with simulation data.\n",

      "Texte : Modern cars are evolving in many ways. Technologies such as infotainmentsystems and companion mobile applications collect a variety of personal datafrom drivers to enhance the user experience. This paper investigates the extentto which car drivers understand the implications for their privacy, includingthat car manufacturers must treat that data in compliance with the relevantregulations. It does so by distilling out drivers' concerns on privacy andrelating them to their perceptions of trust on car cyber-security. Aquestionnaire is designed for such purposes to collect answers from a set of1101 participants, so that the results are statistically relevant. In short,privacy concerns are modest, perhaps because there still is insufficientgeneral awareness on the personal data that are involved, both for in-vehicletreatment and for transmission over the Internet. Trust perceptions oncyber-security are modest too (lower than those on car safety), a surprisingcontradiction to our research hypothesis that privacy concerns and trustperceptions on car cyber-security are opponent. We interpret this as a cleardemand for information and awareness-building campaigns for car drivers, aswell as for technical cyber-security and privacy measures that are trulyconsiderate of the human factor.\n",

      "Texte : Immunotherapies use components of the patient immune system to selectivelytarget cancer cells. The use of CAR T cells to treat B-cell malignancies--leukaemias and lymphomas-- is one of the most successful examples, with manypatients experiencing long-lasting complete responses to this therapy. Thistreatment works by extracting the patient's T cells and adding them the CARgroup, which enables them to recognize and target cells carrying the antigenCD19+, that is expressed in these haematological tumors.  Here we put forward a mathematical model describing the time response ofleukaemias to the injection of CAR T-cells. The model accounts for mature andprogenitor B-cells, tumor cells, CAR T cells and side effects by incorporatingthe main biological processes involved. The model explains the earlypost-injection dynamics of the different compartments and the fact that thenumber of CAR T cells injected does not critically affect the treatmentoutcome. An explicit formula is found that provides the maximum CAR T cellexpansion in-vivo and the severity of side effects. Our mathematical modelcaptures other known features of the response to this immunotherapy. It alsopredicts that CD19+ tumor relapses could be the result of the competitionbetween tumor and CAR T cells analogous to predator-prey dynamics. We discussthis fact on the light of available evidences and the possibility ofcontrolling relapses by early re-challenging of the tumor with stored CAR Tcells.\n",

      "Texte : In this paper, we present CarGameAR: An Integrated AR Car Game AuthoringInterface for Custom-Built Car Programed on Arduino Board. The car consists ofan Arduino board, an H-bridge, and motors. The objective of the project is tocreate a system that can move a car in different directions using a computerapplication. The system uses Unity software to create a virtual environmentwhere the user can control the car using keyboard commands. The car's motion isachieved by sending signals from the computer to the Arduino board, which thendrives the motors through the H-bridge. The project provides a cost-effectiveand efficient way to build a car, which can be used for educational purposes,such as teaching programming. Moreover, this project is not limited to thecontrol of the car through keyboard commands in a virtual environment. Thesystem can be adapted to support augmented reality (AR) technology, providingan even more immersive and engaging user experience. By integrating the carwith AR, the user can control the car's motion using physical gestures andmovements, adding an extra layer of interactivity to the system. This makes thecar an ideal platform for game development in AR, allowing the user to createdriving games that blend the physical and virtual worlds seamlessly.Additionally, the car's affordability and ease of construction make it anaccessible and valuable tool for teaching programming and principles in a funand interactive way. Overall, this project demonstrates the versatility andpotential of the car system, highlighting the various applications andpossibilities it offers for both education and entertainment.\n",

      "Texte : Typically, autonomous cars optimize for a combination of safety, efficiency,and driving quality. But as we get better at this optimization, we start seeingbehavior go from too conservative to too aggressive. The car's behavior exposesthe incentives we provide in its cost function. In this work, we argue for carsthat are not optimizing a purely selfish cost, but also try to be courteous toother interactive drivers. We formalize courtesy as a term in the objectivethat measures the increase in another driver's cost induced by the autonomouscar's behavior. Such a courtesy term enables the robot car to be aware ofpossible irrationality of the human behavior, and plan accordingly. We analyzethe effect of courtesy in a variety of scenarios.

      "Texte : Car detection, particularly through camera vision, has become a major focusin the field of computer vision and has gained widespread adoption. Whilecurrent car detection systems are capable of good detection, reliable detectioncan still be challenging due to factors such as proximity between the car,light intensity, and environmental visibility. To address these issues, wepropose cross-domain Car Detection Model with integrated convolutional blockAttention mechanism(CDMA) that we apply to car recognition for autonomousdriving and other areas. CDMA includes several novelties: 1)Building a completecross-domain target detection framework. 2)Developing an unpaired target domainpicture generation module with an integrated convolutional attention mechanismwhich specifically emphasizes the car headlights feature. 3)AdoptingGeneralized Intersection over Union (GIOU) as the loss function of the targetdetection framework. 4)Designing an object detection model integrated withtwo-headed Convolutional Block Attention Module(CBAM). 5)Utilizing an effectivedata enhancement method. To evaluate the model's effectiveness, we performed areduced will resolution process on the data in the SSLAD dataset and used it asthe benchmark dataset for our task. Experimental results show that theperformance of the cross-domain car target detection model improves by 40% overthe model without our framework, and our improvements have a significant impacton cross-domain car recognition.\n",

This thesis investigates how to optimize traffic flowon highways, in particular for merging situations such as intersections where aramp leads onto the highway. In our work, cars are equipped with sensors thatcan detect distance to neighboring cars, and communicate their velocity andacceleration readings with one another. Sensor-enabled cars can locallyexchange sensed information about the traffic and adapt their behavior muchearlier than regular cars.  We propose proactive algorithms for merging different streams ofsensor-enabled cars into a single stream. A proactive merging algorithmdecouples the decision point from the actual merging point. Sensor-enabled carsallow us to decide where and when a car merges before it arrives at the actualmerging point. This leads to a significant improvement in traffic flow asvelocities can be adjusted appropriately. We compare proactive mergingalgorithms against the conventional priority-based merging algorithm in acontrolled simulation environment. Experiment results show that proactivemerging algorithms outperform the priority-based merging algorithm in terms offlow and delay.\n",

Accordingly, the security of assistant andself-drive systems in the cars becomes a life-threatening issue as smart carscan be invaded by malicious attacks that cause traffic accidents. Currently,canonical machine learning and deep learning methods are extensively employedin car hacking detection. However, machine learning and deep learning methodscan easily be overconfident and defeated by carefully designed adversarialexamples. Moreover, those methods cannot provide explanations for securityengineers for further analysis. In this work, we investigated Deep BayesianLearning models to detect and analyze car hacking behaviors. The Bayesianlearning methods can capture the uncertainty of the data and avoidoverconfident issues. Moreover, the Bayesian models can provide moreinformation to support the prediction results that can help security engineersfurther identify the attacks.

      "Texte : Once self-driving car becomes a reality and passengers are no longer worryabout it, they will need to find new ways of entertainment. However, retrievingentertainment contents at the Data Center (DC) can hinder content deliveryservice due to high delay of car-to-DC communication. To address thesechallenges, we propose a deep learning based caching for self-driving car, byusing Deep Learning approaches deployed on the Multi-access Edge Computing(MEC) structure. First, at DC, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) is used to predictthe probabilities of contents to be requested in specific areas. To reduce thecar-DC delay, MLP outputs are logged into MEC servers attached to roadsideunits. Second, in order to cache entertainment contents stylized for carpassengers' features such as age and gender, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)is used to predict age and gender of passengers. Third, each car requests MLPoutput from MEC server and compares its CNN and MLP outputs by using k-meansand binary classification. Through this, the self-driving car can identify thecontents need to be downloaded from the MEC server and cached. Finally, weformulate deep learning based caching in the self-driving car that enhancesentertainment services as an optimization problem whose goal is to minimizecontent downloading delay. To solve the formulated problem, a Block SuccessiveMajorization-Minimization (BS-MM) technique is applied. The simulation resultsshow that the accuracy of our prediction for the contents need to be cached inthe areas of the self-driving car is achieved at 98.04% and our approach canminimize delay.\n",

While thetraditional operations of the car-sharing service highly relied on humanengagements in fleet management, modern car-sharing platforms let users uploadcar images before and after their use to inspect the cars without a physicalvisit. To automate the aforementioned inspection task, prior approachesutilized deep neural networks. They commonly employed pre-training, a de-factotechnique to establish an effective model under the limited number of labeleddatasets. As candidate practitioners who deal with car images would presumablyget suffered from the lack of a labeled dataset, we analyzed a sophisticatedanalogy into the effectiveness of pre-training is important. However, priorstudies primarily shed a little spotlight on the effectiveness of pre-training.Motivated by the aforementioned lack of analysis, our study proposes a seriesof analyses to unveil the effectiveness of various pre-training methods inimage recognition tasks at the car-sharing platform. We set two real-worldimage recognition tasks in the car-sharing platform in a live service,established them under the many-shot and few-shot problem settings, andscrutinized which pre-training method accomplishes the most effectiveperformance in which setting. Furthermore, we analyzed how does thepre-training and fine-tuning convey different knowledge to the neural networksfor a precise understanding.\n",

We apply the Huygens-Fresnel Wave-based ElectricField Superposition (HF-WEFS) method combined with the radiating dipoleapproximation to compute the effects of scattering-induced distortions of focalexcitation fields on the far-field CARS signal. We analyze the effect ofspherical scatterers, placed in the vicinity of the focal volume, on the CARSsignal emitted by different objects (2{\\mu}m diameter solid sphere, 2{\\mu}mdiameter myelin cylinder and 2{\\mu}m diameter myelin tube). We find thatdistortions in the CARS signals arise not only from attenuation of the focalfield but also from scattering-induced changes in the spatial phase thatmodifies the angular distribution of the CARS emission. Our simulations furthershow that CARS signal attenuation can be minimized by using a high numericalaperture condenser. Moreover, unlike the CARS intensity image, CARS imagesformed by taking the ratio of CARS signals obtained using x- and y-polarizedinput fields is relatively insensitive to the effects of spherical scatterers.Our computational framework provide a mechanistic approach to characterizingscattering-induced distortions in coherent imaging of turbid media and mayinspire bottom-up approaches for adaptive optical methods for image correction.\n",

The acceleration $a(t)$ is heldapproximately constant for a certain time interval, followed by a jump to a newacceleration. These jumps seem to include a deterministic and a randomcomponent; the time $T$ between subsequent jumps is random, too. This leads toa dynamic, that never reaches a fixed-point ($a(t) \\to 0$ and velocitydifference to the car in front $\\Delta v \\to 0$) of the car-following dynamics.The existence of such a fixed-point is predicted by most of the existingcar-following theories. Nevertheless, the phase-space distribution is clusteredstrongly at $\\Delta v=0$. Here, the probability distribution in $\\Delta v$ is(for small and medium distances $\\Delta x$ between the cars) described by$p(\\Delta v) \\propto \\exp(-|\\Delta v|/\\Delta v_0)$ indicating a dynamic thatattracts cars to the region with small speed differences.

A systemconsisting of different cars is modelled by a system of two types of carsdiffering in maximal velocity or efficiency of brakes. Starting fromconditional probabilities and using principle of maximum entropy, probabilitydensities of car velocities and headways are calculated. It is shown that thefirst-order phase transition between free flow and congested traffic may bedriven by number of fast cars in a system of slow cars, and, as a rule,admixture of cars of superior qualities does not increase but decreases thetotal flow. In the system of cars with poor brakes platoons of cars of the samevelocity are formed. They are dissolved by a small addition of cars with goodbrakes.

      "Texte : Crowding on train cars is a common problem plaguing the major public transitagencies around the world. On one hand a crowded train car presents a negativeexperience for the passengers, while on the other hand it indicatedinefficiencies in the train system. The Federal Transit Agency is interested inreducing the crowding level on public transit train cars. Automatic passengercounters (APC) are commonly used to count the passengers boarding and alightingthe train cars. Advanced APC solutions are available based on EO/IR sensors andvisual object detection technology, but are considerably expensive for largescale deployment. This report discusses a low-cost approach to APC by usingaccelerometer measurements from train car to estimate approximate passengerloading. Accelerometer sensor can measure train car vibration as the trainmoves along the rail tracks. The train car vibration changes with the passengerloading on the car. Detecting this change in vibration pattern with changingpassenger loading level is key to the accelerometer based APC solution.Moreover, accelerometer sensors present a low-cost APC solution compared toexisting EO/IR based APCs. This work presents a (i) theoretical model analysis(ii) experimental data driven approach to demonstrate the feasibility of usingaccelerometer for passenger loading estimation.\n",

Today I think only BMW does it on some models.Fender turn signal indicators, I recall these best on the '64-66 Thunderbird. Amber lights on the top front corners of the front fenders. They served as both turn signal indicators that were more visible than versions on the dash.

However, with the increasing burden of expanding populations andrapid urbanization in recent decades, public transportation systems and freighttraffic are suffering huge pressure, plaguing local governments and strainingeconomies. Engineers and researchers have started to re-examine, propose, anddevelop the underused near-ground spaces (NGS) for transportation purposes. Forinstance, flying cars, which are not a totally novel idea, aim at solving thetraffic congestion problem and releasing the strains on existing city transportnetworks by utilizing unoccupied NGS. Flying cars differ from traditionalgrounded transportation systems that are entirely limited by their physicalspace, such as trains on tracks or automobiles on roads. Flying cars do notoccupy or compete for high-altitude spaces used by air traffic forlong-distance transfer. However, there is a clear lack of specific literatureon flying cars and flying car transportation systems (FCTS), which this paperaims to address by describing modern advances, techniques, and challenges ofFCTS. We explore the inherent nature of NGS transportation and devise usefulproposals to facilitate the construction and commercialization of FCTS.

To reducecarbon emissions from the passenger car sector, both countries have consideredvarious policy levers affecting fuel prices, car prices and fuel economy. Thisstudy estimates the responsiveness of new car buyers in China and India to suchpolicy levers and drivers including income. Furthermore, we estimate thepotential for rebound effect and the effectiveness of a feebate policy. Toaccomplish this, we developed a joint discrete-continuous model of car choiceand usage based on revealed preference survey data from approximately 8000 newcar buyers from India and China who purchased cars in 2016-17. Conditional onbuying a new car, the fuel consumption in both markets is found to berelatively unresponsive to fuel price and income, with magnitudes of elasticityestimates ranging from 0.12 to 0.15. For both markets, the mean segment-leveldirect elasticities of fuel consumption relative to car price and fuel economyrange from 0.57 to 0.65. The rebound effect on fuel savings due to cost-freefuel economy improvement is found to be 17.1% for India and 18.8% for China. Arevenue-neutral feebate policy, with average rebates and fees of up to around15% of the retail price, resulted in fuel savings of around 0.7% for bothmarkets. While the feebate policy's rebound effect is low - 7.3% for India and1.6% for China - it does not appear to be an effective fuel conservationpolicy.\n",

However, the car can misunderstand the issued command or the visualsurroundings which could lead to uncertain situations. It is desirable that theself-driving car detects these situations and interacts with the passenger tosolve them. This paper proposes a model that detects uncertain situations whena command is given and finds the visual objects causing it. Optionally, aquestion generated by the system describing the uncertain objects is included.We argue that if the car could explain the objects in a human-like way,passengers could gain more confidence in the car's abilities. Thus, weinvestigate how to (1) detect uncertain situations and their underlying causes,and (2) how to generate clarifying questions for the passenger. When evaluatingon the Talk2Car dataset, we show that the proposed model, \\acrfull{pipeline},improves \\gls{m:ambiguous-absolute-increase} in terms of $IoU_{.5}$ compared tonot using \\gls{pipeline}. Furthermore, we designed a referring expressiongenerator (REG) \\acrfull{reg_model} tailored to a self-driving car settingwhich yields a relative improvement of \\gls{m:meteor-relative} METEOR and\\gls{m:rouge-relative} ROUGE-l compared with state-of-the-art REG models, andis three times faster.\n",

Though many datasets on classifying,detecting, and instance segmenting on car exterior exist, these large datasetsare not relevant for design practices as the primary purpose lies in autonomousdriving or vehicle verification. Therefore, we release GP22, composed of carstyling features defined by automotive designers. The dataset contains 1480 carside profile images from 37 brands and ten car segments. It also containsannotations of design features that follow the taxonomy of the car exteriordesign features defined in the eye of the automotive designer. We trained thebaseline model using YOLO v5 as the design feature detection model with thedataset. The presented model resulted in an mAP score of 0.995 and a recall of0.984. Furthermore, exploration of the model performance on sketches andrendering images of the car side profile implies the scalability of the datasetfor design purposes.\n",

      "Texte : We present results from observations of H110alpha recombination-line emissionat 4.874 GHz and the related 4.8-GHz continuum emission towards the CarinaNebula using the Australia Telescope Compact Array. These data provideinformation on the velocity, morphology and excitation parameters of theionized gas associated with the two bright HII regions within the nebula, Car Iand Car II. They are consistent with both Car I and Car II being expandingionization fronts arising from the massive star clusters Trumpler 14 andTrumpler 16, respectively. The overall continuum emission distribution at 4.8GHz is similar to that at lower frequencies. For Car I, two compact sources arerevealed that are likely to be young HII regions associated with triggered starformation. These results provide the first evidence of ongoing star formationin the northern region of the nebula. A close association between Car I and themolecular gas is consistent with a scenario in which Car I is currently carvingout a cavity within the northern molecular cloud. The complicated kinematicsassociated with Car II point to expansion from at least two different centres.All that is left of the molecular cloud in this region are clumps of dense gasand dust which are likely to be responsible for shaping the striking morphologyof the Car II components.\n",

Therefore, the riseof used cars sales is exponentially increasing. Car sellers sometimes takeadvantage of this scenario by listing unrealistic prices owing to the demand.Therefore, arises a need for a model that can assign a price for a vehicle byevaluating its features taking the prices of other cars into consideration. Inthis paper, we use supervised learning method namely Random Forest to predictthe prices of used cars. The model has been chosen after careful exploratorydata analysis to determine the impact of each feature on price. A Random Forestwith 500 Decision Trees were created to train the data. From experimentalresults, the training accuracy was found out to be 95.82%, and the testingaccuracy was 83.63%.

      "Texte : A rather simple car driving simulator was created based on the available opensource engine TORCS and used to analyze the basic features of human behavior incar driving within the car-following setups. Eight subjects with differentskill in driving real cars participated in these experiments. They wereinstructed to drive a virtual car without overtaking the lead car driven bycomputer at a fixed speed and not to lose sight of it. Moreover, theseexperiments were conducted with four different speed including 60km/h, 80km/h,100km/h, and 120km/h. Based on the collected data the distribution of theheadway, velocity, acceleration, and jerk are constructed and compared withavailable experimental data collected previously by the analysis of the realtraffic flow. A new model for car-following is proposed capture the foundproperties. As the main results we draw a conclusion that the human behavior incar driving should be categorized as a generalized intermittent control withnoise-driven activation of the active phase. Besides, we hypothesize that theextended phase space required for modeling human actions in car driving has tocomprise four phase variables, namely, the headway distance, the velocity ofcar, its acceleration, and the car jerk, i.e., the time derivative of the caracceleration. This time, the time pattern of pedal pushing and the distributionof time derivative of pedal was utilized in addition to previous variables.Moreover, all subjects' driving data were categorized as some styles with theirshapes.\n",

      "Texte : This paper presents a method for learning And-Or models to represent contextand occlusion for car detection and viewpoint estimation. The learned And-Ormodel represents car-to-car context and occlusion configurations at threelevels: (i) spatially-aligned cars, (ii) single car under different occlusionconfigurations, and (iii) a small number of parts. The And-Or model embeds agrammar for representing large structural and appearance variations in areconfigurable hierarchy. The learning process consists of two stages in aweakly supervised way (i.e., only bounding boxes of single cars are annotated).Firstly, the structure of the And-Or model is learned with three components:(a) mining multi-car contextual patterns based on layouts of annotated singlecar bounding boxes, (b) mining occlusion configurations between single cars,and (c) learning different combinations of part visibility based on car 3D CADsimulation. The And-Or model is organized in a directed and acyclic graph whichcan be inferred by Dynamic Programming. Secondly, the model parameters (forappearance, deformation and bias) are jointly trained using Weak-LabelStructural SVM. In experiments, we test our model on four car detectiondatasets --- the KITTI dataset \\cite{Geiger12}, the PASCAL VOC2007 cardataset~\\cite{pascal}, and two self-collected car datasets, namely theStreet-Parking car dataset and the Parking-Lot car dataset, and three datasetsfor car viewpoint estimation --- the PASCAL VOC2006 car dataset~\\cite{pascal},the 3D car dataset~\\cite{savarese}, and the PASCAL3D+ cardataset~\\cite{xiang_wacv14}.

At the transition, thenumber of parked cars $N_p$ diverges in both cases, with the length of the road$N_s$, as $N_p\\sim N_s^{y_p}$ with $y_p=1/2$.

      "Texte : As an adoptive cellular therapy, Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell (CART-cell) therapy has shown remarkable success in hematological malignancies, butonly limited efficacy against solid tumors. Compared with blood cancers, solidtumors present a unique set of challenges that ultimately neutralize thefunction of CAR T-cells. One such barrier is antigen heterogeneity -variability in the expression of the antigen on tumor cells. Success of CART-cell therapy in solid tumors is unlikely unless almost all the tumor cellsexpress the specific antigen that CAR T-cells target. A critical question forsolving the heterogeneity problem is whether CAR T therapy induces bystandereffects, such as antigen spreading. Antigen spreading occurs when CAR T-cellsactivate other endogenous antitumor CD8 T cells against antigens that were notoriginally targeted. In this work, we develop a mathematical model of CART-cell therapy for solid tumors that takes into consideration both antigenheterogeneity and bystander effects. Our model is based on in vivo treatmentdata that includes a mixture of target antigen-positive and targetantigen-negative tumor cells. We use our model to simulate large cohorts ofvirtual patients to gain a better understanding of the relationship betweenbystander killing. We also investigate several strategies for enhancing thebystander effect and thus increasing the overall efficacy of CAR T-cell therapyfor solid tumor.\n",

Combined with the advancement ofArtificial Intelligence and simulation, such groups can be simulated, andsafety-critical models can be learned controlling the cars within. This studyapplies reinforcement learning to the problem of multi-agent car parking, wheregroups of cars aim to efficiently park themselves, while remaining safe andrational. Utilising robust tools and machine learning frameworks, we design andimplement a flexible car parking environment in the form of a Markov decisionprocess with independent learners, exploiting multi-agent communication. Weimplement a suite of tools to perform experiments at scale, obtaining modelsparking up to 7 cars with over a 98.1% success rate, significantly beatingexisting single-agent models. We also obtain several results relating tocompetitive and collaborative behaviours exhibited by the cars in ourenvironment, with varying densities and levels of communication. Notably, wediscover a form of collaboration that cannot arise without competition, and a'leaky' form of collaboration whereby agents collaborate without sufficientstate. Such work has numerous potential applications in the autonomous drivingand fleet management industries, and provides several useful techniques andbenchmarks for the application of reinforcement learning to multi-agent carparking.\n",

      "Texte : In parking problems, a given number of cars enter a one-way streetsequentially, and try to park according to a specified preferred spot in thestreet. Various models are possible depending on the chosen rule forcollisions, when two cars have the same preferred spot. In classical parkingfunctions, if a car's preferred spot is already occupied by a previous car, itdrives forward and looks for the first unoccupied spot to park. In this work,we introduce a variant of classical parking functions, called \"friendshipparking functions\", which imposes additional restrictions on where cars canpark. Namely, a car can only end up parking next to cars which are its friends(friendship will correspond to adjacency in an underlying graph). Wecharacterise and enumerate such friendship parking functions according to theiroutcome permutation, which describes the final configuration when all cars haveparked. We apply this to the case where the underlying friendship graph is thecycle graph. Finally, we consider a subset of classical parking functions,called \"cyclic parking functions\", where cars end up in an increasing cyclicorder. We enumerate these cyclic parking functions and exhibit a bijection topermutation components.\n",

      "Texte : Recently different formulations of the first-order Lighthill-Whitham-Richards(LWR) model have been identified in different coordinates and state variables.However, there exists no systematic method to convert higher-order continuummodels into car-following models and vice versa. In this study we propose asimple method to enable systematic conversions between higher-order continuumand car-following models in two steps: equivalent transformations of variablesbetween Eulerian and Lagrangian coordinates, and finite differenceapproximations of first-order derivatives in Lagrangian coordinates. With themethod, we derive higher-order continuum models from a number of well-knowncar-following models. We also derive car-following models from higher-ordercontinuum models. For general second-order models, we demonstrate that thecar-following and continuum formulations share the same fundamental diagram,but the string stability condition of a car-following model is different fromthe linear stability condition of a continuum model. This study revealsrelationships between many existing models and also leads to a number of newmodels.\n",

      "Texte : We clarify relationships between conditional (CAR) and simultaneous (SAR)autoregressive models. We review the literature on this topic and find that itis mostly incomplete. Our main result is that a SAR model can be written as aunique CAR model, and while a CAR model can be written as a SAR model, it isnot unique. In fact, we show how any multivariate Gaussian distribution on afinite set of points with a positive-definite covariance matrix can be writtenas either a CAR or a SAR model. We illustrate how to obtain any number of SARcovariance matrices from a single CAR covariance matrix by using Givensrotation matrices on a simulated example. We also discuss sparseness in theoriginal CAR construction, and for the resulting SAR weights matrix. For a realexample, we use crime data in 49 neighborhoods from Columbus, Ohio, and showthat a geostatistical model optimizes the likelihood much better than typicalfirst-order CAR models. We then use the implied weights from the geostatisticalmodel to estimate CAR model parameters that provides the best overalloptimization.\n",

      "Texte : Car-hailing services have become a prominent data source for urban trafficstudies. Extracting useful information from car-hailing trace data is essentialfor effective traffic management, while discrepancies between car-hailingvehicles and urban traffic should be considered. This paper proposes a genericframework for estimating and analyzing urban traffic patterns using car-hailingtrace data. The framework consists of three layers: the data layer, theinteractive software layer, and the processing method layer. By pre-processingcar-hailing GPS trace data with operations such as data cutting, map matching,and trace correction, the framework generates tensor matrices that estimatetraffic patterns for car-hailing vehicle flow and average road speed. Ananalysis block based on these matrices examines the relationships anddifferences between car-hailing vehicles and urban traffic patterns, which havebeen overlooked in previous research. Experimental results demonstrate theeffectiveness of the proposed framework in examining temporal-spatial patternsof car-hailing vehicles and urban traffic. For temporal analysis, urban roadtraffic displays a bimodal characteristic while car-hailing flow exhibits a'multi-peak' pattern, fluctuating significantly during holidays and thusgenerating a hierarchical structure. For spatial analysis, the heat mapsgenerated from the matrices exhibit certain discrepancies, but the spatialdistribution of hotspots and vehicle aggregation areas remains similar.\n",

      "Texte : The usability of ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft has beenconsiderably improved by advancements in cellular communications. Such atech-driven transportation system can reduce the number of private cars, inroads with limited physical capacity, effectively match drivers with passengersrequesting service, and save drivers and passengers time by optimal schedulingand estimating of the trips. However, the existing services offered byride-sharing companies may not necessarily reduce congestion, if they are notequitably accessed in urban areas. This paper addresses this important issue byclassifying cars as ride-sharing and non-ride-sharing cars and developing anovel dissensus-based traffic evolution dynamics to effectively model theirdistribution in a shared network of interconnected roads (NOIR). This newdynamics models the ride-sharing car evolution as a non-stationary Markovprocess with uncertainty matrices decomposed into outflow and tendencyprobability matrices, where outflow probabilities are constrained by thenon-ride-sharing cars behavior, but the tendency probabilities are consideredas decision variables (or distributed controls) for achieving an equitabledistribution of ride-sharing cars in a congested traffic.\n",

Thedriver delegates the control to the autonomous system while remaining seated inthe driver's seat. The proposed study aims at giving a first insight into thedefinition of human perception of space applied to vehicles by testing theexistence of a personal space around the car.It aims at measuring proxemicinformation about the driver's comfort zone in such conditions.Proxemics, orhuman perception of space, has been largely explored when applied to humans orto robots, leading to the concept of personal space, but poorly when applied tovehicles. In this article, we highlight the existence and the characteristicsof a zone of comfort around the car which is not correlated to the risk of acollision between the car and other road users. Our experiment includes 19volunteers using a virtual reality headset to look at 30 scenarios filmed in360{\\textdegree} from the point of view of a passenger sitting in the driver'sseat of an autonomous car.They were asked to say \"stop\" when they feltdiscomfort visualizing the scenarios.As said, the scenarios voluntarily avoidcollision effect as we do not want to measure fear but discomfort.The scenariosinvolve one or three pedestrians walking past the car at different distancesfrom the wings of the car, relative to the direction of motion of the car, onboth sides. The car is either static or moving straight forward at differentspeeds.The results indicate the existence of a comfort zone around the car inwhich intrusion causes discomfort.The size of the comfort zone is sensitiveneither to the side of the car where the pedestrian passes nor to the number ofpedestrians. In contrast, the feeling of discomfort is relative to the car'smotion (static or moving).Another outcome from this study is an illustration ofthe usage of first person 360{\\textdegree} video and a virtual reality headsetto evaluate feelings of a passenger within an autonomous car.\n",

This paper uses a double lens toassess people's privacy while they drive a car. The first approach is objectiveand studies the readability of privacy policies that comes with cars. Weanalyse the privacy policies of twelve car brands and apply well-knownreadability indices to evaluate the extent to which privacy policies arecomprehensible by all drivers. The second approach targets drivers' opinions toextrapolate their privacy concerns and trust perceptions. We design aquestionnaire to collect the opinions of 88 participants and draw essentialstatistics about them. Our combined findings indicate that privacy isinsufficiently understood at present as an issue deriving from driving a car,hence future technologies should be tailored to make people more aware of theissue and to enable them to express their preferences.\n",

Car fluent recognition entails aunified framework for car detection, car part localization and part statusrecognition, which is made difficult by large structural and appearancevariations, low resolutions and occlusions. This paper learns aspatial-temporal And-Or hierarchical model to represent car fluents. Thelearning of this model is formulated under the latent structural SVM framework.Since there are no publicly related dataset, we collect and annotate a carfluent dataset consisting of car videos with diverse fluents.

Various $\\ast$-endomorphisms of theCuntz algebra are explicitly constructed, and transcribed into those of the CARalgebra. In particular, a set of $\\ast$-endomorphisms of the CAR algebra intoits even subalgebra are constructed. According to branching formulae, which areobtained by composing representations and $\\ast$-endomorphisms, it is shownthat a KMS state of the CAR algebra is obtained through the above even-CARendomorphisms from the Fock representation. A $U(2^p)$ action on ${\\mathcalO}_{2^p}$ induces $\\ast$-automorphisms of the CAR algebra, which are given bynonlinear transformations expressed in terms of polynomials in generators. Itis shown that, among such $\\ast$-automorphisms of the CAR algebra, there existsa family of one-parameter groups of $\\ast$-automorphisms describing timeevolutions of fermions, in which the particle number of the system changes bytime while the Fock vacuum is kept invariant.\n",

      "Texte : Car sharing is expected to reduce traffic congestion and pollution in citieswhile at the same time improving accessibility to public transport. However,the most popular form of car sharing, one-way car sharing, still suffers fromthe vehicle unbalance problem. Innovative solutions to this issue rely oncustom vehicles with stackable capabilities: customers or operators can drive atrain of vehicles if necessary, thus efficiently bringing several cars from anarea with few requests to an area with many requests. However, how to model acar sharing system with stackable vehicles is an open problem in the relatedliterature. In this paper, we propose a queueing theoretical model to fill thisgap, and we use this model to derive an upper-bound on user-based relocationcapabilities. We also validate, for the first time in the related literature,legacy queueing theoretical models against a trace of real car sharing data.Finally, we present preliminary results about the impact, on car availability,of simple user-based relocation heuristics with stackable vehicles. Our resultsindicate that user-based relocation schemes that exploit vehicle stackabilitycan significantly improve car availability at stations.\n",

We propose the first automatic system to detect idling cars,using infrared (IR) imaging and deep networks.  We rely on the differences in spatio-temporal heat signatures of idling andstopped cars and monitor the car temperature with a long-wavelength IR camera.We formulate the idling car detection problem as spatio-temporal eventdetection in IR image sequences and employ deep networks for spatio-temporalmodeling. We collected the first IR image sequence dataset for idling cardetection. First, we detect the cars in each IR image using a convolutionalneural network, which is pre-trained on regular RGB images and fine-tuned on IRimages for higher accuracy. Then, we track the detected cars over time toidentify the cars that are parked. Finally, we use the 3D spatio-temporal IRimage volume of each parked car as input to convolutional and recurrentnetworks to classify them as idling or not. We carried out an extensiveempirical evaluation of temporal and spatio-temporal modeling approaches withvarious convolutional and recurrent architectures.

      "Texte : Autonomous cars can perform poorly for many reasons. They may have perceptionissues, incorrect dynamics models, be unaware of obscure rules of human trafficsystems, or follow certain rules too conservatively. Regardless of the exactfailure mode of the car, often human drivers around the car are behavingcorrectly. For example, even if the car does not know that it should pull overwhen an ambulance races by, other humans on the road will know and will pullover. We propose to make socially cohesive cars that leverage the behavior ofnearby human drivers to act in ways that are safer and more sociallyacceptable. The simple intuition behind our algorithm is that if all the humansare consistently behaving in a particular way, then the autonomous car probablyshould too. We analyze the performance of our algorithm in a variety ofscenarios and conduct a user study to assess people's attitudes towardssocially cohesive cars. We find that people are surprisingly tolerant ofmistakes that cohesive cars might make in order to get the benefits of drivingin a car with a safer, or even just more socially acceptable behavior.\n",

The system is not characterized by a Hamiltonian but by aconditional probability of a velocity of a car for the given velocity anddistance of the car ahead. Distribution of car velocities for various densitiesof a group of cars are derived as well as probabilities of density fluctuationsof the group for different velocities. For high braking abilities of carsfree-flow and congested phases are found. Platoons of cars are formed forsystem of cars with inefficient brakes. A first order phase transition betweenfree-flow and congested phase is suggested.\n",

      "Texte : A fair simple car driving simulator was created based on the open sourceengine TORCS and used in car-following experiments aimed at studying the basicfeatures of human behavior in car driving. Four subjects with different skillin driving real cars participated in these experiments. The subjects wereinstructed to drive a car without overtaking and losing sight of a lead cardriven by computer at a fixed speed. Based on the collected data thedistributions of the headway distance, the car velocity, acceleration, and jerkare constructed and compared with the available experimental data for the realtraffic flow. A new model for the car-following is proposed to capture thefound properties. As the main result, we draw a conclusion that human actionsin car driving should be categorized as generalized intermittent control withnoise-driven activation. Besides, we hypothesize that the car jerk togetherwith the car acceleration are additional phase variables required fordescribing the dynamics of car motion governed by human drivers.\n",

      "Texte : The problem of a car following a lead car driven with constant velocity isconsidered. To derive the governing equations for the following car dynamics acost functional that ranks the outcomes of different driving strategies isconstructed, which applies to fairly general properties of the driver behavior.Assuming the driver behavior to be rational, the existence of the Nashequilibrium is proved. Rational driving is defined by supposing that a drivercorrects continuously the car motion to follow the optimal path minimizing thecost functional. The corresponding car-following dynamics is described quitegenerally by a boundary value problem based on the obtained extremal equations.Linearization of these equations around the stationary state results in ageneralization of the widely used optimal velocity model. Moreover, it is shownthat there are conditions (the ``dense traffic'' limit) under which therational car dynamics comprises two stages, fast and slow. During the faststage a driver eliminates the velocity difference between the cars, thesubsequent slow stage optimizes the headway. In the ``dense traffic'' limit aneffective Hamiltonian description is constructed. This allows a more detailednonlinear analysis. Finally, the differences between rational and boundedrational driver behavior are discussed. The latter, in particular, justifiessome basic assumptions used recently by the authors to construct acar-following model lying beyond the frameworks of rationality.\n",

When the interchannel interaction reaches a critical value, traffic jamoccurs, which turns out to be of first order phase transition. We derive exactexpressions for the average velocities, the current, the density profile andthe $k$- point density correlation functions. We also obtain the exactprobability of two cars in one lane being distance $R$ apart, provided there isa finite density of cars on the other lane, and show the two cars form a weaklybound state in the jammed phase.\n",

They are for instance used in carconfigurators to offer customers the possibility to configure their car onlineaccording to their personal preferences. However, human-led quality assurancefaces the challenge to keep up with high-volume visual inspections due to thecar models' increasing complexity. Even though the application of machinelearning to many visual inspection tasks has demonstrated great success, itsneed for large labeled data sets remains a central barrier to using suchsystems in practice. In this paper, we propose an active machine learning-basedquality assurance system that requires significantly fewer labeled instances toidentify defective virtual car renderings without compromising performance. Byemploying our system at a German automotive manufacturer, start-up difficultiescan be overcome, the inspection process efficiency can be increased, and thuseconomic advantages can be realized.\n",

      "Texte : Current challenges of car manufacturers are to make roads safe, to achievefree flowing traffic with few congestions, and to reduce pollution by aneffective fuel use. To reach these goals, many improvements are performedin-car, but more and more approaches rely on connected cars with communicationcapabilities between cars, with an infrastructure, or with IoT devices.Monitoring and coordinating vehicles allow then to compute intelligent ways oftransportation. Connected cars have introduced a new way of thinking cars - notonly as a mean for a driver to go from A to B, but as smart cars - a userextension like the smartphone today. In this report, we introduce concepts andspecific vocabulary in order to classify current innovations or ideas on theemerging topic of smart car. We present a graphical categorization showing thisevolution in function of the societal evolution. Different perspectives areadopted: a vehicle-centric view, a vehicle-network view, and a user-centricview; described by simple and complex use-cases and illustrated by a list ofemerging and current projects from the academic and industrial worlds. Weidentified an empty space in innovation between the user and his car:paradoxically even if they are both in interaction, they are separated throughdifferent application uses.

      "Texte : The proliferation of car sharing services in recent years presents apromising avenue for advancing sustainable transportation. Beyond merelyreducing car ownership rates, these systems can play a pivotal role inbolstering grid stability through the provision of ancillary services viavehicle-to-grid (V2G) technologies - a facet that has received limitedattention in previous research. In this study, we analyze the potential of V2Gin car sharing by designing future scenarios for a national-scale service inSwitzerland. We propose an agent-based simulation pipeline that considerspopulation changes as well as different business strategies of the car sharingservice, and we demonstrate its successful application for simulating scenariosfor 2030. To imitate car sharing user behavior, we develop a data-driven modechoice model. Our analysis reveals important differences in the examinedscenarios, such as higher vehicle utilization rates for a reduced fleet size aswell as in a scenario featuring new car sharing stations. These disparitiestranslate into variations in the power flexibility of the fleet available forancillary services, ranging from 12 to 50 MW, depending on the scenario and thetime of the day. Furthermore, we conduct a case study involving a subset of thecar sharing fleet, incorporating real-world electricity pricing data. The casestudy substantiates the existence of a sweet spot involving monetary gains forboth power grid operators and fleet owners. Our findings provide guidelines todecision makers and underscore the pressing need for regulatory enhancementsconcerning power trading within the realm of car sharing.\n",
