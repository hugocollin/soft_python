      "Texte : I imagine this sub is familiar with the new book \"A City on Mars\" by  Kelly and Zach Weinersmith (the latter best known for the brilliant Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal comic). But if you're not: Read it. They make a detailed, intelligent and funny case for slowing down efforts to settle space, diving deep into biology (including poop and sex, as you might expect from SMBC) and technology and space geography and - this is what's most unusual - law and politics. The book makes a very convincing argument that not only are Musk-type space settlement dreams unrealistic to the point of delusional, they risk inflaming country-vs-country tension, which we definitely don't need. It would be better for all to proceed slowly and cautiously, as a global group, just as we have done with Antarctica and the seabed. That sounds like glib crunchy-granola talk but in their hands it's very compelling.\n",

In this paper, developing themethod in the papers much further, we explicitly give projective models of anumber of new Moishezon twistor spaces, as conic bundles over some rationalsurfaces (called minitwistor spaces). These include the twistor spaces studiedin the papers as very special cases.  Our source of the result is a series of self-dual metrics with torus actionconstructed by D. Joyce. Actually, for arbitrary Joyce metrics andU(1)-subgroups of the torus which fixes a torus-invariant 2-sphere, we firstdetermine the associated minitwistor spaces in explicit forms. Next byanalyzing the meromorphic maps from the twistor spaces to the minitwistorspaces, we realize projective models of the twistor spaces of all Joycemetrics, as conic bundles over the minitwistor spaces. Then we prove that forany one of these minitwistor spaces, there exist Moishezon twistor spaces withonly C*-action whose quotient space is the given minitwistor space. This resultgenerates numerous Moishezon twistor spaces which cannot be found in theliterature (including the author's papers), in quite explicit form.\n",

      "Texte : Let $\\mathcal{H}$ be Hilbert space and $(\\Omega,\\mu)$ a $\\sigma$-finitemeasure space. Multiplicatively invariant (MI) spaces are closed subspaces of $L^2(\\Omega, \\mathcal{H})$ that are invariant under point-wise multiplication byfunctions in a fix subset of $L^{\\infty}(\\Omega).$ Given a finite set of data$\\mathcal{F}\\subseteq L^2(\\Omega, \\mathcal{H}),$ in this paper we prove theexistence and construct an MI space $M$ that best fits $\\mathcal{F}$, in theleast squares sense. MI spaces are related to shift invariant (SI) spaces via afiberization map, which allows us to solve an approximation problem for SIspaces in the context of locally compact abelian groups. On the other hand, weintroduce the notion of decomposable MI spaces (MI spaces that can bedecomposed into an orthogonal sum of MI subspaces) and solve the approximationproblem for the class of these spaces. Since SI spaces having extra invarianceare in one-to-one relation to decomposable MI spaces, we also solve ourapproximation problem for this class of SI spaces. Finally we prove thattranslation invariant spaces are in correspondence with totally decomposable MIspaces.\n",

      "Texte : A construction analogous to that of Godefroy-Kalton for metric spaces allowsto embed isometrically, in a canonical way, every quasi-metric space $(X,d)$ toan asymmetric normed space $\\mathcal{F}_a(X,d)$ (its quasi-metric free space,also called asymmetric free space or semi-Lipschitz free space). Thequasi-metric free space satisfies a universal property (linearization ofsemi-Lipschitz functions). The (conic) dual of $\\mathcal{F}_a(X,d)$ coincideswith the nonlinear asymmetric dual of $(X,d)$, that is, the space$\\mathrm{SLip}_0(X,d)$ of semi-Lipschitz functions on $(X,d)$, vanishing at abase point. In particular, for the case of a metric space $(X,D)$, the aboveconstruction yields its usual free space. On the other hand, every metric space$(X,D)$ inherits naturally a canonical asymmetrization coming from its freespace $\\mathcal{F}(X)$. This gives rise to a quasi-metric space $(X,D_+)$ andan asymmetric free space $\\mathcal{F}_a(X,D_+)$. The symmetrization of thelatter is isomorphic to the original free space $\\mathcal{F}(X)$.

      "Texte : In this article, the authors introduce Besov and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces onspaces of homogeneous type in the sense of Coifman and Weiss, prove that these(in)homogeneous Besov and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces are independent of thechoices of both exp-ATIs (or exp-IATIs) and underlying spaces of distributions,and give some basic properties of these spaces. As applications, the authorsshow that some known function spaces coincide with certain special cases ofBesov and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces and, moreover, obtain the boundedness ofCalder\\'on-Zygmund operators on these Besov and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces. Allthese results strongly depend on the geometrical properties, reflected via itsdyadic cubes, of the considered space of homogeneous type. Comparing with theknown theory of these spaces on metric measure spaces, a major novelty of thisarticle is that all results presented in this article get rid of the dependenceon the reverse doubling assumption of the considered measure of the underlyingspace and hence give a final real-variable theory of these function spaces onspaces of homogeneous type.\n",

They all arrive in 2027 signifying the beginning of a commercial presence on Mars.2027: Axiom Station detaches from the ISS.2027: MZ's dearMoon lunar flyby mission launches via Starship the first commercial astronauts to leave Earth's orbit.2027: Artemis III lands the first humans on the Moon for the first time in 55 years at the south pole via Starship HLS.2028: Dennis Tito's lunar flyby occurs.2028: The Nanoracks space station Starlab is launched into orbit.2029: SpaceX launches a Starship to Mars carrying cargo critical to a future crewed mission2029: Artemis IV lands humans on the Moon again via Starship HLS, at this point Artemis missions start to occur at a yearly cadence with that launch cadence continuously getting faster. In this year the final module of the Lunar Gateway is delivered and the foundations of a permanent base on the surface also begin to develop.2031: The first crewed mission to Mars is launched via Starship to Arcadia Planitia, the crew is a mix of NASA and international astronauts as well as private individuals, they spend the full 26 months on Mars and then are mostly or entirely rotated.2031: China launches its first crewed mission to the Moon, likely involving Russia and other international partners, creating the foundations for a permanent base.2031: ISS has been fully decommissioned at this point and is deorbited into the South Pacific.2033: A second crewed Starship is sent to Mars with a \\~2x larger amount of people than the previous one, a number of whom are private individuals who intend to stay indefinitely.\n",

We obtain that the space $C(K,E)$ ofthe vector-valued continuous functions is a GL-space whenever $E$ is, and showthat the GL-space is stable under $c_0$-, $l_1$- and $l_\\infty$-sums. As anapplication, we prove that the Mazur-Ulam property holds for a larger class ofBanach spaces, called local-GL-spaces, including all lush spaces and GL-spaces.Furthermore, we generalize the stability properties of GL-spaces tolocal-GL-spaces. From this, we can obtain many examples of Banach spaces havingthe Mazur-Ulam property.\n",

      "Texte : We have 30 years to plan and build a mission to comet 1P/Halley.My thoughts would be a multi-part mission consisting of:1. A landing craft that is capable of locking onto the surface during the approach to the Sun, and remaining on the surface for the trip back out to beyond Neptune. The purpose to log changes to the comet for as long as possible through its orbit. Ideally with sufficient processing and data capacity for the return of video from the surface.2. A sample collection and return system atop the landing craft that can collect rock and ice from the comet, possibly by drilling into the interior somewhat. In order to be able to study the physical and chemical composition of the comet in a controlled, pristine state.3. A companion satellite to accompany the comet on it's journey through the solar system. The purpose is to provide an overview of the satellite, and to act as a relay for the landing craft given it is unknown how often the lander will have direct line-of-sight to the Earth for data relay.We have already proven all the technology needed to make this happen. \n",

They are reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces contractivelycontained in the Bergman space of the unit disk. K. Zhu analyzed sub-BergmanHilbert spaces associated with finite Blaschke products, and proved that theyare norm equivalent to the Hardy space. Later S. Sultanic found a differentproof of Zhu's result, which works in weighted Bergman space settings as well.In this paper, we give a new approach to this problem and obtain a strongerresult.

It is also the first \"popular\" video I¬¥m aware of which gets the negative lift approach and the belly flop right.However one major part of the video is completely wrong.Starship will ***not*** slow down via its engines prior to hitting the martian atmosphere for aerobraking. It will hit the atmosphere at interplanetary velocity.The erroneous idea that spacecraft *intended to land* on Mars have to slow down before aerobraking has emerged on the internet in the recent months. And I don't know why.All the rovers NASA has send to Mars in the last 20 years didn't slow down before aerobraking. They slammed into the atmosphere and used their heat shields to slow down until they were slow enough to deploy parachutes or execute their landing burns..This post is intended to clear up this misconception and maybe generate a bit of publicity for how EDL (entry decent landing) actually works for spacecraft.\n",

We define intersection space complexes inan axiomatic way, similar to Goresky-McPherson axioms for intersectioncohomology.

We characterize existence anduniqueness of intersection space complexes in terms of the derived category ofconstructible complexes. We show that intersection space complexes of algebraicvarieties lift to the derived category of Mixed Hodge Modules, endowingintersection space cohomology with a Mixed Hodge Structure. We find classes ofexamples admitting intersection space complex, and counterexamples notadmitting them; they are in particular the first examples known not admittingBanagl intersection spaces.

      "Texte : The paper is devoted to isometric Banach-space-theoretical structure oftransportation cost (TC) spaces on finite metric spaces. The TC spaces are alsoknown as Arens-Eells, Lipschitz-free, or Wasserstein spaces. A new notion of aroadmap pertinent to a transportation problem on a finite metric space has beenintroduced and used to simplify proofs for the results on representation of TCspaces as quotients of $\\ell_1$ spaces on the edge set over the cycle space. ATolstoi-type theorem for roadmaps is proved, and directed subgraphs of thecanonical graphs, which are supports of maximal optimal roadmaps, arecharacterized. Possible obstacles for a TC space on a finite metric space $X$preventing them from containing subspaces isometric to $\\ell_\\infty^n$ havebeen found in terms of the canonical graph of $X$. The fact that TC spaces ondiamond graphs do not contain $\\ell_\\infty^4$ isometrically has been derived.In addition, a short overview of known results on the isometric structure of TCspaces on finite metric spaces is presented.\n",

      "Texte : It follows, from a generalised version of Paley-Wiener theorem, that theLaplace transform is an isometry between certain spaces of weighted $L^2$functions defined on $(0, \\infty)$ and (Hilbert) spaces of analytic functionson the right complex half-plane (for example Hardy, Bergman or Dirichletspaces). We can use this fact to investigate properties of multipliers andmultiplication operators on the latter type of spaces. In this paper we presenta full characterisation of multipliers in terms of a generalised concept of aCarleson measure. Under certain conditions, these spaces of analytic functionsare not only Hilbert spaces but also Banach algebras, and are thereforecontained within their spaces of multipliers. We provide some necessary as wellas sufficient conditions for this to happen and look at its consequences.\n",

This is one of the better meteor showers of the year, with 110 meteors per hour if skies are clear and often produces a number of bright meteors called fireballs. But this year moonlight interferes. The source of the Quadrantids is thought to be the asteroid 2003 EH1, which might actually be an extinct comet. This meteor stream gets its name because the meteors appear to radiate out from four stars near the constellation Bo√∂tes, which includes the bright star Arcturus, just after the handle of the Big Dipper. ‚òÄÔ∏è Jan 3: Earth at closest to Sun (perihelion).

      "Texte : A matrix space of size $m\\times n$ is a linear subspace of the linear spaceof $m\\times n$ matrices over a field $\\mathbb{F}$. The rank of a matrix spaceis defined as the maximal rank over matrices in this space. A matrix space$\\mathcal{A}$ is called rank-critical, if any matrix space which properlycontains it has rank strictly greater than that of $\\mathcal{A}$.  In this note, we first exhibit a necessary and sufficient condition for amatrix space $\\mathcal{A}$ to be rank-critical, when $\\mathbb{F}$ is largeenough. This immediately implies the sufficient condition for a matrix space tobe rank-critical by Draisma (Bull. Lond. Math. Soc. 38(5):764--776, 2006),albeit requiring the field to be slightly larger.  We then study rank-critical spaces in the context of compression andprimitive matrix spaces. We first show that every rank-critical matrix spacecan be decomposed into a rank-critical compression matrix space and arank-critical primitive matrix space. We then prove, using our necessary andsufficient condition, that the block-diagonal direct sum of two rank-criticalmatrix spaces is rank-critical if and only if both matrix spaces are primitive,when the field is large enough.\n",

      "Texte : To remove the confusion of concepts about different sorts of geographicalspace and dimension, a new framework of space theory is proposed in this paper.Based on three sets of fractal dimensions, the geographical space is dividedinto three types: real space (R-space), phase space (P-space), and order space(O-space). The real space is concrete or visual space, the fractal dimension ofwhich can be evaluated through digital maps or remotely sensed images. Thephase space and order space are both abstract space, the fractal dimensionvalues of which cannot be estimated with one or two maps or images. Thedimension of phase space can be computed by using time series, and that oforder space can be determined with cross-sectional data in certain time. Threeexamples are offered to illustrate the three types of spaces and fractaldimension of geographical systems. The new space theory can be employed toexplain the parameters of geographical scaling laws, such as the scalingexponent of the allometric growth law of cities and the fractal dimension basedon Horton's laws of rivers.\n",

      "URL : https://www.reddit.com//r/space/comments/18yfn76/stratospheric_tourism_over_suborbital_tourism/\n",
      "Texte : In the past few years, space tourism has become more active than ever, previously it was the occasional billionaire being sent up on Soyuz every now and then, but now SpaceX has contract for five futures missions (Polaris 1-3, dearMoon, and Tito's flight). And additionally, Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic are now actively sending launchings flights of tourists on suborbital hops quite frequently.Suborbital space tourism is more popular then ever, and now 60 people have gone to space as passengers via that method. However, the suborbital hop strategy only allocates those people around 5-10 minutes in space, which is quite little compared to the days, weeks, or even months that orbital flights granted their passengers.The easy argument against the previous statement though is simple: orbital tourism is too expensive for the average customer. Space tourism to orbit costs about $50 million per seat right now, which is a lot more than the $450K it costs to fly with Virgin Galactic for example. However, 5-10 minutes is still not a long time, so perhaps another alternative should be considered.Another easy alternative is stratospheric tourism, there are currently companies such as World View Enterprises and Space Perspective that seek to creates balloon-based spacecraft that can bring passengers to an altitude of about \\~30km above sea level for a few hours, where they'd be above >99% of the atmosphere. The common argument against this idea though is that that's not space, its the stratosphere. Although that's true, ultimately does it even matter?Suborbital tourism, whether its at 80km or 100km is also in the \"atmosphere\", its in the mesosphere/thermosphere. If you were a person at 30km, 80km, or 100km without a suit or protective barrier of any kind, the result would be the same at each altitude: you become a dead human. Also if you're above >99% of the atmosphere, what you're seeing is gonna look essentially like space.The purpose of this post isn't just to shit on suborbital tourism, what BO and VG are doing is great for increasing space accessibility. But logically speaking, are there really any downsides for the customer who choose a stratospheric flight over a suborbital one? I suppose they would get any zero-g because its a balloon, but you can also get zero-g here on Earth in planes that go on routes designed to give people the zero-g experience. This means the main difference between stratospheric and suborbital flights for the customer would ultimately be time, they'd get hours in space as opposed to minutes. Even though they technically wouldn't be going into space, is this a better service? What do you all think?\n",

Let me know if you‚Äôve got any ideas to improve the format, and please share any news-related thoughts, insights and missed stories with everyone in the comments. Sources are in the comments too.1/ **SpaceX's Falcon Heavy Launches U.S. Military Spaceplane**SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket successfully deployed the U.S. Space Force's X-37B spaceplane from Kennedy Space Center on Dec. 28. This launch, a first for the X-37B aboard Falcon Heavy and SpaceX's 97th in 2023, carried a payload of U.S. military and NASA experiments. Details of the mission and its intended orbit are classified, yet it's anticipated to surpass the altitudes of previous missions.2/ **Axelspace secures $44 Million in Series D Funding**Japanese Earth observation company Axelspace raised nearly $44 million in Series D funding to expand its satellite constellation and develop smallsats for other applications. The Tokyo-based firm, which operates five microsatellites offering medium-resolution imagery, will also support its AxelLiner initiative for producing microsatellites for customers, with a demo satellite launch planned for early 2024.3/ **Elon Musk reiterates stance on taking Starlink public**Elon Musk reiterated his reluctance to take Starlink public in the near term, emphasizing the need for stable and predictable cash flows before considering an IPO. SpaceX's Starlink, with over 5,200 satellites in orbit and 2.3 million users, is focused on expanding global broadband coverage. Musk has often contrasted SpaceX's private funding model with that of publicly traded companies, citing long-term planning advantages of remaining private.4/ **NASA Advances Earth System Observatory Missions**NASA is advancing its ambitious Earth System Observatory, a series of costly Earth science missions, amidst budget uncertainties. These pivotal missions, integral to NASA's future Earth science endeavors, are currently in development stages, aiming for launches from late 2020s to early 2030s. Despite facing fiscal challenges and dependency on fluctuating budgets, the program has received Senate support.5/ **Japan's SLIM Spacecraft Preps for Precision Moon Landing**Japan's SLIM spacecraft, having entered lunar orbit on Dec. 25, is preparing for a precision moon landing on Jan. 19. The mission aims to be Japan‚Äôs first lunar soft landing, focusing on accurate landing technology with a lightweight architecture. SLIM carries two innovative rovers and scientific equipment for surface experiments, including analyzing lunar crater compositions. The success of SLIM could reduce future lunar exploration costs.\n",

Although Roger Penrose won the Nobel Prize in physics just a few years ago for demonstrating how black holes come to exist in our Universe, singularities and all, the subject isn't closed. We've never peered beneath the event horizon, and have no way of detecting what's inside. Using a powerful mathematical argument, Kerr argues that singularities shouldn't physically exist.&#x200B;\n",
